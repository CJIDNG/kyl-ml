Nigeria Airways
hot for sale now

—Idris Kuta

hairman, Senate
Committee on
Aviation, Senator
Idris Kuta said yesterday in
Abuja that the Nigeria
Airways will not be
privatised now, at least not
in the next 18 months.

Speaking exclusively to
Daily Trust, Kuta said his
committee had convinced
President Olusegun
Obasanjo to delay privatising
the sick national carrier until
it has been resuscitated.

“We pressurised the
president and he agreed with
us that nobody is going to
sell the Nigeria Airways the
way it is today. So, in the
next 18 months, Nigeria Air-
ways will not be privatised.
Instead, it will be revived and
brought to a condition where
it will sell properly. After it
has been revived, all inter-
ested buyers can now come
and buy,” Kuta explained.

According to Kuta, the
Senate is disturbed by the
fact that certain people want
to rush the privatisation of
the airline so that they can
pay “peanuts” for it.

“T don’t think they should
be given the opportunity to
do that. The commercial price
of the Nigeria Airways must
be paid. Anybody who feels
he is going to get a bargain
is wasting his time,” he as-
serted.

Kuta explained that his
stand on the issue was in-
formed by his experience as
a polo player.

Said he: “I am a polo
player and I keep horses.
When one of them dies I pay
money to have it buried.
When we came in May 1999,
Nigeria Airways was a dead
horse, so we put our heads
together in order to give it a
kiss of life. It is now reviving
but not well enough to be
sold.

“So you see, you cannot
sell a dead horse. People
would only buy a healthy
horse. The more healthy, the
costlier. The airline should be
revived before anyone
dreams of selling it.”

Obasanjo, Atiku speak at Yar’ Adua memorial lecture

resident Olusegun
ey Obasanjo and Vice

President Atiku
Abubakar are expected as
special quests to the 3% Na-
tional Yar’ Adua memorial lec-
ture scheduled for Saturday
in Abuja.

The event, billed to hold
at the Nicon Noga Hotel, will
also feature the president,
Islamic Development Bank
(IDB), Saudi Arabia Dr.
Ahmed Mohammed Ali, Spe-
cial guest Speaker on the
topic, “South-South Coop-
eration.”

A statement by the Direc-
tor, Shehu Musa Yar’Adua
Foundation, Ms Jamilah W.
Farris, issued at the state
house, Abuja, said the Na-
tional Troupe of Nigeria

By Suleiman Mohammed

 

would also present a play
entitled: “Tafida,” commis-
sioned by the foundation
and written by Dr. Ahmed
Yerima.

The play captures the life
and times of the Tafidan
Katsina, examines his vision
for a united and democratic
Nigeria and his commitment
to building a free and just so-
ciety for all.

Similarly, a vasatile actor
and lecturer at the Ahmadu
Bello University, Zaria, Salihu
Baffa and another actor,
Albert Akaeze are expected
to perform on the roles of
“Tafida and Mutawalli” re-
spectively.

The Shehu Yar’Adua

Foundation, which was es-
tablished in 1998 shortly af-
ter his death, aims at encour-
aging present and future gen-
erations of Nigerians to em-
brace the leadership qualities
of a man whose “courage and

Micheal and Harshon
Saba, in the circumstances,
was barbaric and reminiscent
of the stone-age when
civilisation of whatever form
was unknown.

Mr. Justice Eri said fur-
ther that from a careful ob-
servation of the three men
throughout the trial, it was
apparent they had no re-
morse for their action and
were, therefore, unfit for a
decent society.

Reviewing the entire
case, the Chief Judge noted
that while the three were sup-
posed to be on peace-keep-
ing operation at Okene on
Febraury 17, 2001, they con-
nived to rob theirsvictims and
set them ablaze.

Additionally he said, they
forcefully removed from their
victims, the sum of N1.4 mil-
lion.

(6 ops contd. from pg I

Passing the judgement,
Justice Eri said the Justice of
the case demands that the
said total sum of N586,850.00
recovered from the police-
men be given to one Jimoh
Saka, who escaped from the
point of operation.

It would be recalled that
in mid-February this year, the
five policemen, Benjamin
Oyahire, Jimoh Micheal and
Garshon Saba all attached to
the Kogi State police com-
mand were arrested, dis-
missed and charged to court
for robbery.

In their reaction, the
Nigeria police has described
the death sentence
pronounced on the three
policemen who robbed some
traders in Lokoja in February
and set hem ablaze as a good
and reliable judgement.

Speaking with the News

Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in
Abuja, the force Public
Relations Officer (FPRO), Mr.
Haz Iwendi, said the
judgement would serve as a
lesson to other members of
the force.

Iwendi further said that

the Nigeria Police was happy ~

with the dismissal, arrest and
prosecution of the three
policemen, as it was part of
the cleansing exercise of the
force, adding that “they
deserve what they got”.

“The policemen were not
sent on that assignment,” he
said and queried: “If a man
does something illegal, how
can we back him?”

“With this judgement, we
have learnt our lessons and
others have also learnt
theirs”, he said, noting “this
will surely serve as a lesson
to officers and men of the
force.”

commitment to democracy”

He described as disgrace-
ful, a situation where Nigeria
has been forced by the dwin-
dling fortunes of its national
career to sign bilateral agree-
ments with British Airways
and South African Airways.
“If small countries like
Ghana, Cameroon, even
Sudan, Kenya and a large
country like South Africa
have more planes than Nige-

Tia it is disgraceful,

“Nigeria Airways has
only two 737 one DC 10 that
are flying, South African Air-
way has well over 44 aircraft,
from 747s to 737s that are fly-
ing. Ghana Airways has more
than seven. It is bad that a
country like Nigeria, the gi-
ant of Africa has not got a
single plane that can fly to
Europe and America,” the
Senator lamented.

The House had passed a
resolution on September 14,
2000, mandating its educa-

the alleged missing N40 bil-
lion, following series of peti-
tions it received alleging
large-scale at the ETF.

According to Rep. Shehu
Matazu, the chairman, House
committee on education who
briefed National Assembly
correspondents yesterday,
the committee which has
five-point terms of reference
is expected to expend N16
million on the public hearing.

The committee during the
public hearing is to establish
to what extent the Education

and the management of ETF
observed the principles of
transparency, accountability
and probity in the manage-
ment of the funds placed at
their disposal for the benefit
of the nation’s educational

view to eliminating all factors
militating against its smooth

He disclosed that the Su-
preme Council for Islamic
Affairs would organise a na-
tional conference on moon
sighting to put a stop to the
lack of uniformity in observ-
ing Islamic festivities.

He said that the confer-

ence would examine the mer-
its and demerits of using cal-
endar and physical sighting
of the lunar moon in deter-
mining the actual dates for
Islamic festivities.

He said that an accept-
able compromise would be
worked out to achieve uni-

He disclosed that for the
president to accept and start
implementing the recommen-
dation of the 1999 constitu-
tion by convening a national
conference, is synonymous
with passing a vote of no
confidence on the entire po-
litical process.

He said “the contempla-
tion of the constitution is for
the president to operate with
an elected national assembly,
so for him to create any par-
allel body to the national as-
sembly would mean forfeit-
ing the protection of the con-
stitution that legitimises both
himself and the legislative
arm of government.”

Obas anjo contd. from pg 1

“T believe that our prob-
lems could better be inter-
preted as failure of the gov-
ernment, not of the system.
We don’t need a national
conference to know that the
economy is in comatose, to
also know that the govern-
ment has failed to rehabilitate
our infrastructure, to know of
its failure to provide ad-
equate and consistent power
supply, to know that it has
failed dissimally in the sup-
ply and distribution of petrol
and also its failure to improve
our educational sector and
employment of our youths,”
he'said:

Convening a national
conference according to
Senator Idris Abubakar is an
escape route for the
government’s failure in all its
ramifications, as it would lead
to a possible break up of the
country.

He said “the break u of
the country is of course an
agenda of those who do not
relish the idea of one Nige-
ria, so that they would use
the conference if convened,
to achieve their agenda. This
I suspect, is in complete har-
mony with the agenda of the
of the local minority in the
Nigerian politics”

 

at a recent meeting with the
Airline Operators of Nigeria,
condemned the poor perfor-
mance of airlines involved in
airlifting pilgrims for this
year’s hajj, saying it was cal-
lous for the airlines to aban-
don pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.

The president regretted
the patronage of the airlines
while dismissing their agita-
tion to operate international
routes on the ground that
they lacked the aircraft, facili-
ties and personnel to fly such
routes.

Over 7000 Nigerian pil-
grims were reported to have
been abandoned in the holy
land by the airlines at the end
of the pilgrimage, even as the
Federal Government
subsidised the operation to
the tune of N715 million, in
addition to other measures to
ensure a hitch-free operation
this year.

The airlines approved for
this year’s hajj were Albarka,
Freedom, Kabo_ and
Chanchangi. .

to evaluate the role of the
Federal Inland Revenue Ser-
vice (FIRS) in the assess-
ment, collection and ac-
counting of the ETF since
January 1, 1993, as well as
establish the level of compli-
ance by all registered com-
panies in the country with
the provisions of Decree 7,
establishing the ETF.

Moreover, the role of the
CBN in the pooling, ware-
housing and accounting for
the accrued funds is to be
evaluated by the committee,
just as it is mandated to es-
tablish cases, if any of cor-
ruption, mismanagement,
abuse of office, staff
victimisation and misappro-
priation of funds by the board
of ETF.

The house education
committee chairman, Rep.
Matazu explained that the
public hearing was not meant
to with-hunt, adding “we are

not witch-hunting or indict-

ing anybody.

“Nothing will influence
the final report of the public
hearing, no matter the black-
mail and intimidation,” he
assured,

Meanwhile, the final re-
port submitted by the con-
sultant to the committee
(Standard Cybernetics Lim-
ited) showed that over $200
million (N2.5 billion) with-
holding tax collected by ETF
from foreign shipping lines
may have been lost to fraud.

Furthermore, the consult-

. ants, apart from revealing

that the ETF can recover an-
other N15 billion from oil
companies, hitherto not col-
lected, further indicted the
Federal Inland Revenue Ser-
vice, the CBN and the office
of the Accountant General for
aiding and abetting the per-
petuation of fraud in the ETF.

ASUU contd. from pg 1

that lectures and examina-
tions were held but there is
general understanding
among the local branches of
ASUU to respect whatever
the out come of the Owerri
meeting was. Dr. Hilary
Nwazozu, former head of de-
partment of Mass Communi-
cation at the University of
Maiduguri and staunch
member of ASUU told Daily
Trust that the decisions from
Owerri would radiate from all
local braches and whatever
was decided would take im-
mediate effect.

Although, he was opti-
mistic that the strike may not
linger for long, as he said
everything depend on how
the government plays it park.

Said he, “we have always
been at the receiving end and
we want an end to all this she-
nanigan by the Federal Gov-
ernment.”

Dr. Nwazozu view was
however supported lecturers
at the university of Abuja and
Kano explaining that the is-
sue of the industrial action is
too premature to discuss as
the ultimatum elapse yester
day.

However, at the Univer-
sity of Abuja, the lecturers
may not go’on strike even if

the Owerri parley opted for it
as Daily Trust gathered that
both the Academic Union
and National Association of
Nigerian Students (NANS)
were said to have entered into
an agreement allowing the
students to end their semes-
ter examination on Thursday.

Daily Trust was told by
an official of ASUU, Univer-
sity of Abuja chapter that,
both the students union and
the Vice Chancellor of the
university, Dr. Gambo Laraba
Abdullahi have made spir-
ited appeals to them to halt
the strike, as students have
just four days to end their ex-
aminations.

The branch he said, had
accepted the dispassionate
appeal, “but we have told
them, that we are going to
embark on the industrial ac-
tion if the Owerri meeting
opted for the strike immedi-
ately after the examinations.

ASUU, University of
Abuja chapter he said. is
fully participating in the ac-
tivities of ASUU at national
the levels as both the presi-
dent Dr. Saint Gbilekaa and
Dr. Hamza Na-Uzo, the sec-
retary have gone to Owerri
for the union’s national meet-
ing.” 7 .

~ Oil workers threaten
nationwide strike

he National
Executive Council
(NEC) of the

Independent Marketers
branch of NUPENG rose
from its meeting over the
weekend in Jos with a
decision to embark on a
nationwide strike if
Independent Petroleum
Marketers Association of
Nigeria (IPMAN) fails to
implement the Abuja
agreement on _ their
(marketers) .conditions of
service.

Addressing newsmen on
Saturday after the meeting
held at the Tudun Wada
Government Lodge, the Na-
tional President of the asso-
ciation, Comrade wale
Adenuga, said when their
strike commenced, the inde-
pendent marketers will stop
the lifting of IPMAN prod-
ucts at all the nation’s depots
until the latter signed the
employee’s conditions of
service.

According to the national
president, the union had
agreed on 30 out of the 34
conditions of service tabled
by the marketers which in-
cluded minimum wage of
N8000.00 per month includ-
ing medical bills and hous-
ing allowances.

Others are maternity
leave for female workers, 15
working days annual leave
and 10 days compassionate
leave.

 

From Buhari Bello, Jos

The point yet to be re-
solved is that of industrial ac-
cident, for the members.

He observed that with the
present understanding be-
tween the marketers and
members of IPMAN, there
would be fewer cases of fric-
tion “as we have made them
to realise that we are not
coming to take over their

new jobs, we are partners in
progress.”

Continuing he said, “be-
ing recognised by IPMAN
fully, -we shall now assure
them of our loyalty and dedi-
cation to service.”

The union president also
said his union was not in sup-
port of the deregulation of
the oil sector and called on
the Federal Government to
reverse its decision immedi-
ately.

 

Supreme court declares Nasarawa traditional seat vacant

he Supreme Court,
has finally declared
the traditional stool

of Andoma of Doma in
Nasarawa State vacant after
dismissing the appeal filed
by Alhaji Yahaya Ari Doma
against the judgement of a
Jos High Court and Court of
Appeal which separately
declared his selection null
and void.

In a unanimous decision,
the apex court in a judgement
delivered by Justice M.E.
Ogundare on behalf of the
four other judges, held that
Alhaji Yahaya Ari Doma’s
appeal “is completely devoid
of any merit” and accord-
ingly upheld the decision of
the lower court on the mat-
ter.

With this development,
the first-class stool of the
Andoma of Doma, in
Nasarawa State would now

 

From Buhari Bello, Jos

 

 

 

remain vacant, ending the
nine-year bloody and legal
tussle.

The court in its judge-
ment delivered on March 12,
2001 also awarded the sum
of N10,000.00 as cost to be
paid by Alhaji Yahaya Ari
Doma to the respondents in
the case which included
Alhaji Muhammadu Rajab
Ogiri, Alhaji Abdulrahman
Idris and Alhaji Hussaini
Ogwu.

The struggle for the
Andoma stool started in
1992, when the three
kingmakers went to Jos High
Court to challenge their re-
moval from office by then
the Plateau State government
from the traditional council
so as to facilitate Alhaji Ari
Doma’s_ selection as
Andoma of Doma.

DAILTY-A\TRUST

EDITORIAL
Adamu B. Augie
(1940-2001)

Ts death last Tuesday of Senator Adamu Baba Augie,

  
 

journalist, broadcaster, commentator, publisher and

media consultant was as shocking as it is tragic. At
61, the APP Senator from Kebbi North died in a ghastly
motor accident on his way to Argungu, his hometown, after
a condolence visit to Funtua in Katsina State.

By his death, journalism has lost one of its very visible
members, whose career came to its peak, in public eye, with
the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) broadcast of the
VERDICT ‘79. The programme, gave a blow-by-blow account
of the1979 elections. Arguably, the programme became the
most authentic medium for getting accurate results inspite
of the poor communications then. His impeccable diction
and microphone voice combined to become a magnet that
pulled viewers, young and old, male and female. By the time
the elections were through, Adamu Augie as MR VERDICT
‘79 became a household name.

Although Adamu Augie stumbled into journalism at the
defunct Broadcasting Company of Northern Nigeria (BCNN)
in 1961, he lived it all his life. He made the profession re-
spectable and proved that journalism could do well with de-
cent and fair-minded professionals. As a war correspondent
for the Radio Television, Kaduna between 1967 and 1970,
Adamu Augie gave succinct and factual reports about the
progress of the war. And, although he reported from the
Federal side, his reports were devoid of the morbid war pro-
paganda. Though in war, truth is usually the first casualty,
Adamu Augie reported the truth as much as his patriotism
and sense of fairness would allow.

It was, therefore, not surprising that his rise from re-
porter to producer was rapid because it was not easy to com-
bine the painstaking search for the truth, a captivating dic-
tion and a microphone voice that came so naturally. It was
not long before he became the Head, News and Current Af-
fairs at the BCNN from where he was appointed the first
Managing Director of the Northwest Television, which be-
came NTV Sokoto and later, NTA Sokoto.

As Managing Director of NTA Sokoto, the station be-
came the best in Nigeria, producing such continental award-
winning movies as Moment of Truth, Cockcrow at Dawn,
Abuja: The Making of a New Capital City and our Neighbours.
Under his tutelage, the station produced the crop of produc-
ers that held or are holding key management positions at
the NTA national headquarters. They include: Kere Ahmed,
Peter Igho, Matt Dadzie, Sadiq Daba, Ade Ayeni and Danladi
Bako to mention a few.

Adamu Augie was better known as a broadcaster and one
of his strongest points was his love for journalism and jour-
nalists. As Managing Director of NTA, Sokoto, the station
lost state government favours because he would rather let
the truth be told than curry favours from the powers that
were. On several occasions, he would incur the wrath of the
state government because of certain reports aired by the
channel. But Adamu Augie was never one to make a scape-
goat of any of his reporters. Rather, he would stand by his
reporter, even if he would caution him later. Today, experi-
ence has shown that this attitude is rare. Indeed, some chief!
executives are the first to fish out and disown a reporter
whose report attracted the ire, justifiably or otherwise, of
the powers that be.

More than that he was one of the detribalized Nigerians
of his time. He was at home in Lagos as he was in Maiduguri,
Enugu or Argungu. His calling brought him into close con-
tact with Nigerians from every corner and he was always at
home with them. Socially, even though he lived in close quar-
ters with the royalty, the rich and the mighty, Adamu Augie
remained a simple and amiable man of the people. He could
have used his high connections to get into more lucrative
callings, but since wealth was not his obsession, Adamu
Augie preferred the simple life of a journalist.

He rose to become the acting Director-General of the
NTA from where he retired in 1986. He veered into politics
in 1990, joining the National Republican Convention (NRC)
on which platform he was elected into the ill-fated Senate in
1992. He was one of the foundation members of the All
People’s Party (APP) in 1998, and was elected Senator from
Kebbi-North. In the Senate, he was Chairman, Senate Com-
mittee on Navy.

His contributions in the Senate since 1993 were very
thought-provoking, detailed and cogent. In announcing the
shocking death, the Senate President, Pius Ayim, said Adamu
was a “man of integrity, who believed in politics without bit-
terness, sportsmanship and respect for the general good of
the people”

Weekly Trust wishes his gentle soul good repose and the
family he left behind the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable
loss.

By Attahiru M. Jega

he Abacha-era added an interesting concept

to our political lexicon: Ta Zarce. In its ordi-

nary, Hausa, meaning, it simply means to con-
tinue straight on. But, in the political context in which
the concept has been popularized, it means to con-
tinue to cling to power, and hold onto an office, by
whatever means necessary. It implies use of power,
to keep power, and it suggests a glorification of abuse
of power.

Now, the ideology of Ta Zarce is becoming a
blooming, albeit dangerous, legacy bequeathed to our
nation through our recent history of reckless misrule.
It has many manifestations: the feverish preparations
for 2003 elections by incumbent office-holders; the
contentious elongation of the term of office of local
government Chairpersons by the Senate; the clamor
for an elongated single-term for the president and
governors; and the more recent struggle at the PDP
Convention for the extension of the term of office of
Gemade and his fellow Executive Council Members.

Ta Zarce is also big business, with big budgets
and big payoffs. There are many spin-doctors pack-
aging and peddling it. There are foot-soldiers as well
as generals of Za Zarce. Then, it is highly infectious,
and does not discriminate against ethnicity, religion or
region. The phenomenon of 7a Zarce has spanned
all nooks and crannies of Nigeria

Thus, it seems as if virtually every elected politi-
cian and his coterie of hangers-on, are ready to wage
struggles and do battles for an elongated tenure. Our
politicians are getting used to power and the rewards
that accompany it. They are reaping immense mate-
rial gains associated with the control of the office, at
the same time that many ofus are suffering and smil-
ing. Now that they are in power, they cannot imagine
life out of power. They are so preoccupied with re-
maining in power that they spend all the time planning
how to ensure this, rather than doing what they have
been elected to do in the first place.

From the trend of things, the craving for an elon-
gated tenure may be the Achilles’ heel of our nascent
democracy. It seems that, increasingly, more time, en-
ergy and public resources are spent on self-perpetua-
tion agenda than on the actual business of socioeco-
nomic provisioning for the Nigerian masses.

The critical question is: how much time is enough
for an elected person to discharge the responsibilities
of his/her office honorably and responsibly? Our poli-
ticians, especially the self-serving types, would tell you
that they need all the time in the world. But, since they
cannot get all the time in the world, then they would
pull as much as they can get. Hence, the recent clamour
for the review.

To my mind, for those constitutionally defined of-
fices, the 1999 Constitution has provided sufficient time
for any person who is serious to do good, solid work
in the office to which he/she has been elected. Two
years is good enough at the local level. Any person
who has done very well can, and should be, re-elected
for another term. Besides, this time-frame ensures that
bad leaders are thrown out before they are do a lot
more damage, while the good ones can be returned
through re-election. Similarly, four years is good
enough for state and federal elective offices.

Fears about the use of incumbency to win re-elec-
tion are legitimate, but they constitute insufficient
grounds for the demands for a mid-stream change to
elongated single-tenures. We need to uphold, practice
and make perfect, the democratic tradition of electing
people for a first term, after which if they have done so
well, they can then be eligible for re-election for a sec-
ond and final term. Violations of the rule of law, elec-
toral rigging and so on, using incumbency need to be
stopped; but they cannot be stopped by a single ten-
ure as many tend to think. I doubt whether they can be
minimized by this. Thus, we should look for more en-
during solutions to these, such as an effective electoral
process, piloted by incorruptible public officers and
well-mobilized and conscientious electorate.

I do not, therefore, believe that there is a real need
for a review of the tenure of our office-holders at this
point in time. I believe that, even in the long-term. a
review is neither here nor there, and we should not
waste too much time on that. There are more impor
tant things to focus on in the review of the 1999 con-
stitution than the tenure of elected officers.

What is significant for me is the record of achieve-
ment of a politician. This should determine whether
the people should allow hinv/hera second chance. Those
who have done well deserve another chance to con-
solidate the good work, while those who have done
poorly and still want to cling on, deserve to be thrown
out with ignominy. Equally significant, of course, is an
enlightened electorate, alive to its civic duties and re-
sponsibilities. This is the best safe-guard to the machi-
nations of crooked incumbents bent on imposing them-
selves in spite of their poor records of public service.

Instead of spending a lot of energy, time and re-
sources on elongation of tenure, let us pay more atten-
tion to having good electoral Taws, a good electoral
process and conscientious and incorruptible elector-
ate. To my mind, these are some of the big challenges
before us, before 2003.

Why this crave to enslave Nigerians?

total dismay the decision

by the Bureau for Public
Enterprises (BPE) to borrow
the whooping sum of $76
million, about N8.89 billion
from the World Bank to fi-
nance the privatization
programme. Daily Trust 8/3/
2001.

The amount is also said
to be for the strengthening of
the activities of the Nigerian
Communications Commis-
sion (NCC), the Nigerian
Telecommunications Lim-
ited (NITEL) and the Lagos
State Water Corporation.
This revelation by Malam
Nasir El-Rufa’i was shocking
for a number of reasons.

First, the privatization
programme was, in the first
place, started at the instance
of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank, which in their own
wisdom, decided that our na-
tional wealth be passed onto
a few select individuals.

For most Nigerians, the
whole programme of
privatization is like a grand
robbery, organised against
them and sanctioned by the
Nigerian State. The masses
look helplessly as the very
wealth, which they have
worked so hard to create, is
being passed into the hands
ofa few predators. This is just
because it pleases the
Brettron Wood institutions
that only a few agents of
theirs should own our na-

tional wealth. Such is the
logic of capitalism, it comes
in the name of efficiency and
globalization. The argument
has been that government-
owned institutions tend to be
corrupted and inefficient.
They must, therefore, be sold
to private individuals.

But as one scholar once
posed the question: “how
many people will want to
commit suicide to cure a
sore? How many people will
want to sell their father’s
house, just because it is leak-
ing, to a carpenter so that they
become labourers of the car-
penter toiling to mend the
house for the new owner?
How many intelligent people
will not seek a way of hav-
ing the house mended while
they retain ownership?”

Secondly, the BPE’s de-
cision to go aborrowing at
this material time is all the
more shocking because by
the admission of its Director-
General, Malam EI-Rufa’i,
there is in fact no real need
for the loan, at least, for now
given the colossal sum of
N190 billion realized from
the first phase of the
programme. Surely Nigeri-
ans need to be told how such
a huge amount of money has
been expanded in the
Bureau’s Privatization
Programme.

Thirdly, the whole idea of
taking foreign loans sounds
ridiculous at this material

time when President
Obasanjo and his entire team
are globe-trotting, begging
the international community
and creditor agencies to
FORGIVE and CANCEL
Nigeria’s debts. How can one
morally justify debt-forgive-
ness when we keep on ask-
ing for more and more loans?
Do we really want to be be-
lieved by the international
community or are we just
deceiving ourselves?

Weall know that these are
the same kinds of dubious
debts whose real needs, utili-
zation and prudent manage-
ment are at best questionable.
Yet we want to take more and
more only for us to turn
around to start shading croco-
dile tears that the burden is
too much on us, that we can-
not pay, that we should be
forgiven. Which is why the
World Bank, the IMF and
other happy creditors are
never for a second amused by
our pretentious plea for can-
cellation. They know, more
than any other body, that we
are neither sincere nor seri-
ous.
Fourthly, laymen like me,
need to be educated on why
the IMF and the World Bank
should force the privatization
programme down our throats
and then lure us into taking a
loan with which to execute
the same programme. It ap-
pears to me a double robbery:
Nigerians forced to part with
their collectively-created
wealth; and yet even that pro-

cess of parting has to be fi-
nanced not only by them (the
masses), but also by their off-
springs -vicariously through
inherited debt. This is im-
moral.

When the West asked us
to do immunization against
Polio, they (understandably)
heavily subsidized the vac-
cines. I believe whatever the
hidden benefit of this immu-
nization programme to the
West, it at least has a more
human face compared to the
privatization.

Finally, Nigerians have
been given the impressions
that since the oil boom of the
Gowon-era, no government
has got so much money in
Nigeria as the Obasanjo ci-
vilian administration. So
even if we must borrow, why
not borrow internally? Why
the crave to further enslave
Nigerians by all means?

Malam EI-Rufa’i, please
do remember that you,
Obasanjo and Babangida'
(who started it all) and every-
body that has a hand in this:
massive wealth appropria-
tion (or misappropriation)
shall definitely one day stand
before Allah (Sub-hanahu
Wa ta’ ala) to give account.

May our accounting be-
fore Him be taken very,
highly. Ameen.

The many benefits of Zakaful

t some point in our
lives, we are faced
with loss, disaster,

and demise of a dear one,
especially the breadwinner,
which can affect our lives
significantly. As Muslims,
what support do we have? It
is important to plan our lives
to ensure that we provide
added security and protec ‘tion
for ourselves and our
families. Within the Musiim
world and developing
countries, wars, disease and
famine are rife; the
traditional family structure
and ties are no longer as
strong as they used to be.
Families are now scattered all
over the world, hence that

breaking point.

This is where Taka/ul
comes in. It offers protection
for risks against property,
health etc. Takaful products
are developed on the concept
of brotherhood and solidar-
ity among participants. Par-
ticipants not only save for
their own future require-
ments, but participants save
also in creating a fund to pay
for the losses of fellow par-
ticipants. It is based on a sys-
tem of cooperation and mu-
tuality; it is the pooling of
common resources to help
the needy.

[By Rakiya Ibrahim Sanusi ]

Takaful policy is against
Tawakkaul (relying totally on
the will of Allah) hence
unIslamic. Taking precau-
tions in planning one’s life is
not against the will of Allah.
In Hadith, when an Arab
Bedouin asked the Holy
Prophet, “Shall I leave my
camel untied and seek
Allah’s protection on it, or
should I tie it? The Holy
Prophet replied “Tie your
camel and then depend on
Allah”.

From this Hadith, it is
clear that taking precautions
is not against Tawakkul. In
fact, it is a pre-requisite to
Sonn.) ora) provides
essential security and safe-
guards against loss and disas-
ter. In so doing, one is able
to save and plan for the fu-
ture. Is saving for the educa-
tion of our children, haram?
Is investing for the future,
haram? Is taking up a family
Takaful policy, which en-
courages savings, haram? Is
Takaful health plan policy for
the family, haram. Surely
not? A Hadith of the Holy
Prophet says: “The one who
looks after and works for a
widow and for a poor person
is like a warrior fighting for
Allah’s cause....” Another
Hadith says: “It is a sin for
someone to neglect and not
to provide for those who de-

 

pend on him”.

It is a concept that is
falsely blamed as being
unislamic. Takaful provides
us with a unique opportunity
to galvanise the savings of
the individual for the good of
the community. It institutes
financial discipline and en-
courages individuals to adopt
suitable financial planning
habits. Takaful, Islamic In-
surance, is a concept that is
yet to gain full acceptance by
the Muslim community.
There is still a lack of aware-
ness about its tremendous
benefits. It is still shrouded
with suspicion.

One example is the
Takaful \ife assurance. It is
widely misunderstood. Is-
lamic life assurance does not
mean assuring one’s life, but
it is a financial transaction of
undertaking a responsibility
towards protecting widows,
orphans and other
dependants of the assured
from future unexpected fi-
nancial risks. It is a policy
that relies on the principle of
mutual cooperation, it does
not involve interest but is
based on mudaraba mode of
financing.

The general public needs
to be educated in order to
correct this misconception
that continues to prevail. Ac-
cording to Sheikh Nizam
Yacubi, a Shariah Scholar,
“It is our duty as practitioners

and Sharia scholars to edu-
cate the general public and
bring this very important
matter of planning and sav-
ing for future needs through
Takaful, to their attention
They must understand that
Takaful is becoming more
important and that it is in ac-
cordance with the Shariah, if
not an incumbent require-
ment of it. Did not the
Prophet say “It is better to
leave your heirs rich than to
leave them poor and need
asking others for help?”

Takaful, being an integral

part of the Islamic financial}

system, is an area that is not}
eves UHroogn anenhon as|
compared to Islamic banking,
Hence it has not developed as
much as Islamic banking,
There is still not enough pub-
lished information available}
on the subject, and a lot of re-
search and development is re
quired in order to develop this
concept to realise its full po-
tential.

Advertising and aggres-
sive marketing with the aim
of not just to sell products on
offer but, also to educate th
public as to what they are an
to understand the basic con:
cept of Takaful, is essential.

Re: Rediscovering the North

he article entitled: “Rediscovering the North” by

Ibrahim Ibrahim, which appeared in the Daily Trust

in series came at no better time than now. In fact, the

article should have been entitled: “Northern Nigeria in per-

spective” to sensitize the readers viewpoint of reference in
understanding the true identity of a northerner.

I would like to commend the writer for finding time to
research and write a historical piece that relates to current
happenings in Nigeria. I will team up with him to condemn
the cowardice of some old southemers for keeping quiet in
the face of anarchy as witnessed during the Lagos crises of
ethnic cleansing. It is quite unfortunate that old men, who
should be morally upright, mature in thinking, organised as
individuals, contented in wealth and dignified in knowledge
kept silent in a situation of total anarchy only to raise their
voices to condemn the introduction of Sharia legal system in
the north. What do they wish to attain in old age that is more
dignifying than to gain respect after their demise? I know
one thing as a sojourner in Lagos for nearly 20 years now.
Yorubas are afraid of being rejected and taunted by their
tribesmen. It is no fallacy among the Yorubas that if you
oppose what was a pre-planned agenda of coercion and in-
timidation of other tribes, your own tribes will rise against
you. This was what we read and know of the ‘Wild, Wild
West Crisis of 1966.’ The legendary Chief Akintola opposed
the so-called sage of the Yoruba race, Chief Obafemi
Awolowo. Such a thing is a great sin to their people. It would
mean the enemy and the punishments death. Chief Akintola
died in such circumstances.

The writer also wrote convincingly on the mode of inte-
gration championed by the northerners in transforming the
entire northern region into one united and indivisible entity.
He wrote “ The leaders from the northern region led purely
for the upliftment of their diverse people. Northern leaders
set examples of leadership buoyed by the role of the elite in
their society, which more often than not formed the yard-
stick for measuring public conduct and character.” This is a
statement of fact, not fallacy. I grew up in the Middle-belt
region as the son of a Hausa-Fulani settler and a native of the
present-day Kogi State. I saw the god-conscious manner of
leadership my grand-father who, migrated freely sometime
around 1900 with his herds of cattle from Shira town in the
present-day Bauchi state and, settled in the Middle-Belt re-
gion.

My grandfather, who was a learned Islamic preacher, left
Shira with the sole aim of propagating Islam. My grandfa-
ther died there in 1932 according to family history. How-
ever, most of his children took to other trades and profes-
sions. One of his children became an influential figure, hav-
ing been made a treasurer within the region in an area domi-
nated by the inhabitants who are of the Igala tribe. He was so
powerful that he was feared among the people owing to his
solid and standard leadership quality. There has been a grow-
ing Hausa community in the locality since 1900’s with many
of them being descendants of Hausas from Kano, Garko in
the present Hadejia State, Zaria, Bauchi, and Borno states.
This explains why I see this eloquent statement as true to
reality in reference to Nigeria’s existence as a nation. “Trib-
alism is a destructive force and its most evil form is the drive
to band together, people of the former South-Western region
against the rest of the country”. “Ethnic hatred has taken con-
trol of those who have been clamouring for the disintegra-
tion of this country....”. The North would remain as one no
matter what detractors in the South-West feel as a people or
some self-centered, half-baked Northerners agitating for
Middle-Belt region really have in mind. It is my grayer it ic
wn prayer.

One serious anathema I sensed among the South West-
erners and their avowed detestation Northemers is the no-
tion that an average northemer is viewed as uneducated, chau-
vinistic and unserious. The most amazing thing about this
sadistic belief is that their wards or descendants have been
brainwashed into thinking that, that is how the Northemer is.
This is an unhealthy development for a country that is the
pride of black peoples. It is not surprising that when may-
hem enveloped Lagos during the OPC crises, a Hausa man
could be slaughtered without blinking @n eye for he was
viewed as a lower animal. A Hausa man, who trades in cows,
goats and sheep, is often referred to as “Nama” meaning
meat but contemptuously as an animal.

The bottom line is we can only accept to live as Nigeri-
ans if we never take ourselves for granted. Despite our dif-
ferences, religious orientations andtcultural backgrounds, we
should learn to respect one another, reason as one Nigerians
in times of peace or war; only then can we be proud as Nige-
rians. ,

The joke is on Obasanjo

he recent front page
| headline of Tribune
newspaper dated 14"
of January, 2001, entitled:
“Presidency aide buys £20
million house” constitutes a
big smear to President
(Obasanjo’s hard line posture
on corruption in Nigeria.
The many reported cases
of corruption in the media in-
dicting high-ranking mem-
bers of the Obasanjo- led ad-
ministration is messing up the
President’s avowed stand on
accountability and transpar-
lency. The situation is even
made worse by the very fact
that those caught in corrupt
practices are treated with kid
gloves as no disciplinary ac-
tion on them has been re-
ported.
From most quarters, skep-
ticism is mounting over Presi-

dent Obasanjo’s willingness
to conduct a thorough inves-
tigation concerning stink-
ingly corrupt individuals that
are his close associates. In-
deed, this has not surprised
many because that was what
happened when John
Fashanu, an ex-international
footballer and sports ambas-
sador of UN, mentioned a
former Head of State in a
multi-billion dollar fraud. Till
date no attempt has been
made by government to
probe the issue probably be-
cause it is rumoured that the
said ex-head of State was in-
strumental to the enthrone-
ment of President Obasanjo.

The growing doubts con-
cerning President Obasanjo’s
sincerity on anti-corruption
will do the government no
good as it can affect its good

intentions. However, in order
to check the unpleasant con-
clusion by many that
Obasanjo is partial and lacks
guts, the government has to
address these issues instead
of directing all its anti-cor-
ruption arsenals on the
Abacha family alone.

Until government be-
comes ready to respect the
yearnings and aspirations of
the people and make the is-
sue of corruption an all-em-
bracing exercise, the people
of Nigeria will see the cru-
sade as a selectives pro-
gramme of the Obasanjo ad-
ministration; a mere vindic-
tive tool at its disposal to
punish its perceived enemies.

yet to stop telling the sad sto-
ries of the failed banks saga
in relation to the hardship and
pains inflicted on their per-

 

sons and businesses.

It will be recalled that in
the IBB and Shonekan days
of governance, most deposi-
tors and bank customers ex-
pressed great disappointment
over most banks’ inability to
meet their demands. There
was a crisis of confidence
and apathy about the bank-
ing industry. But this stopped
when late Gen. Sani
Ahacha’s regime intervened.
How Abacha went about the
restoration of sanity in the
banking sector during his re-
gime and the criticisms that
followed such measures are
not the objective of this
piece, but suffice it to state,
that most banks that were not
meeting their commitments

CBN and the many banking licenses

to their customers were sanc-
tioned and subsequently liq-
uidated.

One important thing the
CBN must bear in mind is
that without strengthening its
measures for monitoring
banks, the new licenses it is
issuing banks will bring us
back to the pre-Abacha days.

Those issuing new li-
censes should please spare us
another round of failed banks
because should the banking
industry experience another
crisis, it may be difficult to
have another administration
that can bring sanity to the
sector like the late Abacha’s
did. That is the reality.

A Prophet and the gullible congregation

ime without number, |
have read a catalogue
of stories in the media
about prophecies on
Obasanjo’s coming to the
throne by some self-ac-
claimed men of God. No
doubt prophecies do exist, but
when such prophecies are
laced with lies and half-truths,
it makes nonsense of the effi-
cacy of prophecies and casts
aspersions on the integrity of
the so-called men of God.
Bishop Okeke, General-
Overseer of God’s Pentecos-
tal Mission’s assertion that he
prophesied Obasanjo coming
to power as stated in the in-
terview he granted the Post
Express newspaper edition of
February 28, 2001, is neither
here or there. But it is ex-
tremely difficult to believe
what he said about Abacha’s
death because death is a nec-

"bed whooping amount that

the guise of the National

ID Card Project is as revealing
as it is shocking.

It is disgusting that the
present administration which
pretends to wear the toga of in-
corruptibility should pump more
money into a white elephant
project such as the National ID
scheme at such a time when most
Nigerians don’t know when their
next meal will be.

One would have thought that
the government will institute a
probe with a view to throwing
more light on the fraud. But it
has become glaring that the
President is always in the habit
of keeping mum in situations
that he is supposed to speak out

 

essary price that must be paid
by all and sundry.

Inspite of the euphoria
that trailed Abacha’s death,
Bishop Okeke as a christian,
should know that Abacha’s
death was an act of God. This
is where a professed man of
God should be faulted. It is
against this backdrop that I
see Bishop Obi Okeke’s ex-
citement over Abacha’s death
as ill-conceived and mischie-
vous.

It may look improper to
lampoon a man of God on the
pages of a newspaper, but it
has become necessary in or-
der to correct some of the mis-
givings contained in the inter-
view.

In as much as one may not
have ready praises for the
Abacha’s government be-
cause conclusions have been
reached, it is, however, glar-

QV LLL DSID IVE)

and clear the air. All we know
now is that the Senate has started
to investigate the National ID
scam.

However, the way the inves-
tigation is being carried out and
the lack of interest of the Execu-
tive in the matter, is an indica-
tion that the probe would likely
turn out to be a fluke and would
not achieve its objectives.

When Mohammed Abacha
was accused of financial impro-
priety, the government did not
send his case to the Senate but
sent Mohammed to court for
trial.

One has started to cast as-
persions on the fairness and in-

ing that the Obasanjo admin-
istration is giving Nigerians
stones instead of bread. So
why should Bishop Okeke en-
gage in praising the Obasanjo
administration? It is sad
enough that security of lives
and property can no longer be
guaranteed, while corruption
is stinking to high heavens. So
what really is worth celebrat-
ing about Obasanjo’s regime?

The likes of Bishop Obi
Okeke should desist from
delving into areas that are not
familiar to them. They should
concentrate on evangelism
and praying for the President
to have the zeal and vision to
lubricate the economy and im-
prove the standard of living of
Nigerians.

fallibility of the present admin-
istration that is fraught with
many socio-economic and po-
litical problems.

The shoddy handling of the
National ID Card issue may not
be unconnected with the impli-
cation of Gen. Babangida in the
deal, a situation where the out-
come of the probe would not
meet the expectations of Nige-
rians.

It is a pointer to the fact that
some Nigerians are more equal
than others thereby throwing,
justice, equity and egalitarian-
ism to the dust.

The many lies

igeria is a theatre of sorts
Nee every character

plays one role or the
other. One such character is Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) who
took us on a merry-go-round for
the eight odd years that he pre-
sided over the affairs of Nige-
ria.

Gen. Babangida’s recent in-
terview “At home with
Babangida” which was pub-
lished in a Sunday edition of
THISDAY newspaper has left me
wondering over what has hap-
pened to his well-known charm-
ing disposition, which saw him
through his reign. In that exclu-
sive interview, Babangida came
out ordinary, a man justifying
most of his actions or outrightly
passing the buck to another per-
son to save his neck.

Most remarkable was the act
of crediting every evil deed of
his administration to late Gen.
Sani Abacha who was appar-
ently the number three man in
hierarchy of the regime. Accord-

ing to Babangida, Abacha was
going to rope him in the Diya
coup of 1997 if not for Air Vice
Marshal Aikhomnu (rtd.) who in-
tervened and persuaded Abacha
for fifteen minutes before the in-
tention was dropped. Lucky
him!

Gen. Babangida’s presenta-
tion of Gen. Abacha as a drag
who rarely contributed in meet-
ings because he usually came
late is a gross contradiction of
belief that Abacha was instru-
mental to the many evils of IBB
regime. By omission or commis-
sion, General Babangida has by
this statement exonerated
Abacha from the shortcomings
of his regime.

It is very amazing that in an
attempt by Babangida to distance
himself from the 12 billion Gulf
War Oil windfall scandal which
gained currency during the
Abacha era, he stated that the
documents relating to the alleged
fraud had four different editions
which were labouriously doc-

of IBB

tored by the Abacha regime in
order to nail him. To boot, he
said he has already intimated
President Obasanjo on this issue
but refused to give the President
the documents because they
were stolen and obtained
through abnormal channels.
Very interesting indeed, as this
will surely make a good analy-
sis elsewhere for most Nigerians
who cannot read between the
lines.

It is high time the press real-
ized that people who played in-

~ glorious roles in the past should
not be given newsprint to distort
history as a way of image-laun-
dering.

Gen. Babangida has spoken
again, but this time with many
lies. The only consolation rests
in the maxim “lie no matter how
far it travels, truth will always
catch up with it”. And that is
where IBB missed the point be-
cause the day of reckoning will
surely come.

T: comments attributed to
the Primate of the Meth-
odist Church of Nigeria,
Sunday Mbang, in the February
12, 2001, edition of The Guard-
ian newspapers entitled: “Mbang
backs Obasanjo”; if true, suggest
that sycophancy has started rear-
ing it’s ugly head even in the
spiritual circles.

It is difficult to believe that
Primate Mbang who, hitherto
was at the vanguard of those bent
on vilifying the late General
Abacha would suddenly cease
offering constructive criticisms
and solutions to the nation’s

daunting problems by canvass-
ing for a fresh tenure for Presi-
dent Obasanjo when it is obvi-
ous that this administration is yet
to accomplish any landmark
achievement despite the fact that
almost half of its tenure is al-
ready gone.

From the interview, it could
be inferred that Primate Mbang
feels that majority of the popu-
lace are now enjoying what can
be generally regarded as a bliss-
ful life expected from the tran-
sition from military to democ-
racy. Wise thinking you may
say.

_Dirsiaie why the President of the
Christian Association of Mige-
ria (CAN) would make such an
assertion in the face of worsen-
ing fuel crisis, wholesome cor-
ruption, galloping inflation and
above all, continued devaluation
of the naira worse than it was
during the Abacha reign.

Mbang’s display can be
likened to a man who is
inconsistent where objectivity is
required. It is unfortunate that
the indefatigable bug, that
blindfolds sycophants to the
gxtent of not calling a spade, a
spade has bitten Primate Sunday

ome of us from this part of the continent
Ss": fascinated by your Movement Sys
tem, your unique no party system. What
is it about and why is it so popular in Uganda?

The Movement System came to Uganda in
1986. This was the time when Museveni came to
power taking over from Milton Obote and it is a
system that became popular because it did away
with the old parties. There was a tendency to blame
all the problems in Uganda on the parties because
the parties were sectarian. For example if you are
from a certain tribe or you belong to a certain reli-
gion, automatically someone will know the party
you belonged to and so they promoted a kind of a
winner takes all kind of situation and brought such
bitter rivalries which eventually led to military jun-
tas. As you know the problems of Uganda you
must know. So the Movement was seen as bring-
ing together the people of Uganda after the aborted
regime to work together under a kind of umbrella
lon a common or minimal program. In other words
let us suppress our freedoms of association in or-
der to work for the development of this country
on a minimal program. But the key thing is that it
was supposed to be a transitory form of govern-
ment. In other words, most of us understood that
after sometimes, the parties would be allowed to
work after we have gained some kind of political
maturity because the movement embarked on seri-
lous political education for the population and we
hoped that new parties would come up that will
not be based on sectarianism and there will be po-
litical space to compete.

Now over time what happened to the move-
ment? | will tell you the principles of the move-
ment type of government. First of all, it is broad-
based meaning that it brings people with different
political beliefs, different social beliefs and they all
work together with this minimal program. It is all
inclusive. In other words, by the constitution of
(Uganda, every single Ugandan is in the movement.
Then another important principle is that when you
compete for one of the offices in that movement
system of government, you do so on individual
merit. Of course there is no party backing you. It
is me Anne. I’ve come here. I give you my CV
(Curriculum Vitae) and I tell you my abilities... It
is on the basis of individual merit that you will
stand, even if you are going to the Parliament, to
the Local Council and“according to law even to
become president.

Recently, there seems to be political par-
ties in Uganda, how do they exist side by side
with the Movement System?

occasion of the foundation stone laying

[Abubakar who really stole the show. When it

“Museveni is a thunderbolt” (1)

Savouring victory in this year's Ugandan presidential election
may not be in President Yoweri Museveni s menu as the emissaries
of the leading contestant, Dr. Kizza Besigye, are traversing the
continent, campaigning to get the results nullified. Anne
Mugisha, his publicity secretary, spoke with the Foreign Desk
Editor, Kevin Ebele Adinnu, in Abuja.

The political parties are expression
of different tendencies. So even if we
are in the movement, we are leaning
towards political parties especially
since they understood the movement
to be a transitionary period. That is
why when we drew up the constitu-
tion in 1995 there is an article 269, which
is the most draconian article.

Now the movement stopped being
a transitionary kind of government. It
became an alternative because the con-
stitution says we can either have a
movement kind of government or we
can have a political party type of gov-
ernment. The constitution went on to
say we shall have a referendum and ev-
ery time the referendum in itself de-
cides that we should have the of move-
ment type of government, the other
type of multi party cannot operate. So
we had a referendum and the referen-
dum decided the movement. Buy that
time, Museveni was very very popu-
lar.

Now the contradiction in the move-
ment came to light with the candidacy Mugisha.

of Dr. Kizza Besigye. When Besigye decided to
run with Museveni under the Movement System
as an individual candidate, the Movement locked

that he should have consulted. Is the movement a

of constructive engagement, he also said, has
meant the visit of various leaders, special
enveys and delegations to the country in
recent times. It is indicative that we have

The desire of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs is that this Foreign Office would be
more than another public building. Hence the
elaborate and involving paper works that
fore-grounded the project. As it siands now,

with Museveni?

It think the main reason, there are several rea-
sons, but the main reason is management. If I’m
going to put it quite simply, President Museveni
has created a situation where he is a law unto him-
self. He has created a situation where he is operat-
ing with cliques usually, family members. You may
have heard of Major General Salim Salim, his brother,
then his in-laws. ..People who are clearly marked
as tainted by cormuption are the people who sur-
round him but most of all he is an institution. The
biggest point of departure between Dr. Besigye and
President Museveni is that Dr. Besigye wants to
build strong institutions. Museveni’s supporters
behave as if they belong to a personality cult.
Museveni is the chairman of the High Command.
Museveni is the minister of defence. Museveni is a
one-man thunderbolt in the Ministry of Defence.
He is the one who decides who is going to buy
ammunitions from where. The control he has over}
the ministry (has made) it a personal institution.
He even declared at the beginning of the election
that if my candidate, Dr. Besigye, talked about the!
army, he would put him six feet under. He said this
at the National Conference of the Movement. So!
he created a situation where only he can be King.

He completely believes that he himself alone
has all the solutions to Uganda’s problems. He has
stifled political competition and as you know that!
brings disenchantment and disgruntlement. People
who have their own other ideas about good gover-
nance do not have a chance. If you disagree with
him, you are finished.

Then, he weakens institutions by creating par-
allel institutions. There is the regular army. Then
you have the PPU (Presidential Protection Unit).
Then you create the Customs Police. Then you
create a new Anti-smuggling Unit. You have about
three parallel institutions doing the same thing some
of whom are directly under his office and all these!

srael has seized at least

And in fresh violence,
French news agency AFP
reports that an Israeli soldier
has been killed by Palestin-
ian gunfire near the village of
Salem outside the West Bank
town of Nablus.

The violence capped a
day of continuing tension as
both sides buried children
killed in confrontations ear-
lier this week.

The Force 17 members
were picked up by under-
cover Israeli special forces
camouflaged with foliage, ac-
cording to witnesses.

Army helicopters hov-
ered overhead during the op-
eration and nearby tanks pro-
vided cover, according to re-
ports.

Palestinian Minister Saeb
Erakat denounced the opera-
tion as an act of “piracy” and
further proof of Israel’s
“organised terrorism”.

But Israeli army chief,
General Shaul Mofaz de-
fended the seizure.

“We will strike where is
necessary at those who com-
mit terrorism and kill civilians
or Israeli soldiers,” he said on
Israeli television.

The Israelis have accused
Force 17 of colluding with
extremist groups such as
Hamas in carrying out attacks
inside Israel.

The Israeli press is full of
speculation that a prolonged
campaign against the Pales-
tinians is in the offing.

The Israeli newspaper
Haaretz quoted security of-
ficials as saying that more air
and ground attacks were im-
minent, as well as more ar-
rests of Palestinian activists.

Last Wednesday, Israeli
helicopters attacked the
Force 17 headquarters and
offices in Ramallah and the

The burial finally went

The money will be in ad-

the past promised donors he
would cut back on defence

modernising the army.

But he told journalists he
was now unsure about cut-
backs, given that Uganda
was in the process of upgrad-
ing the infantry and building

He did not make reference

Admiral Dennis Blair said
that in fact the Chinese

sharply criticised China for
more “aggressive” tactics in
intercepting US planes.

“Jt’s not a normal practice

which was forced to make an

None of the American

“Today we end our

“We have to continue to-

confronting obstacles and
walking among the thorns to
achieve what Mexico wants.”

Four days ago the rebels
appeared before the Mexican
Congress to press for greater
rights for the country’s 10
million indigenous Indians.

The rebel march began
on 25 February and they ar-
rived in Mexico City on 11

The US Pacific Command

But Admiral Blair said
that US officials had had no
contact with the crew since
its initial report that it landed
with no injuries.

“We just don’t know
what has happened to them,”
Admiral Blair said.

“We are waiting right
now for the Chinese govern-
ment to give us the kind of
co-operation that is expected
of countries in situations like
this,” he said. “But as time
goes on, it’s increasingly
worse and it’s been 18 hours
that we don’t have a phone
call yet from our crew.”

for the crew, but did not say
where they were.

27 die at
Pakistani festival
akistani officials said
‘ atleast 27 people have
been crushed to death

and 100 were injured in a
stampede outside the shrine

of an Islamic saint in
Paktattan, 180km_ south of
Lahore.

A police inspector said 20
of the victims died of suffo-
cation when a crowd of thou-
sands of men, who were
crammed in a narrow street,
rushed forward to the shrine’s
main door when it opened.
The rest died of their injuries
in hospital.

The stampede occurred
at the start of a religious fes-
tival in Punjab province.

Every year, an estimated
500,000 people attend reli-
gious rituals marking the an-
niversary of the death of the
Muslim saint Baba Farid Ganj
Shakar, who died in 1265.

Many devotees believe
that entry to heaven is en-
sured if they pass through
the shrine’s Behashti

Milosevic
fights arrest

s former Yugoslav
leader Slobodan
Milosevic starts his

second day in Belgrade’s cen-
tral jail, his lawyer is seeking
to overturn a 30-day deten-
tion order against him.

At the same time, the US
is preparing to deliver its ver-
dict on whether the Yugoslav
authorities have done
enough for it to release about
$50m in aid for the country.

Mr Milosevic’s incarcera-
tion comes after a dramatic
stand-off at his villa ended
peacefully with him being
bundled into an official car
early on Sunday morning.

Police have seized a huge
cache of arms from the villa,
in the exclusive suburb of
Dedinje, including two
armoured personnel carriers,
30 automatic weapons, three
heavy machine guns, a
rocket-propelled grenade
launcher and two cases of
hand grenades.

In the end the former
strongman gave himself up,
but government sources are
quoted as saying any at-
tempt to storm the building
would have ended ina blood-
bath.

In the early hours of Sat-
urday, police special units
had tried to enter the com-
pound but were driven back
by bodyguards defending
Mr Milosevic, who later
threatened to kill himself and
his family rather than surren-
der.

The Yugoslav authorities
intend to try Mr Milosevic
for bringing the nation to its
knees during more than a de-
cade of misrule.

The Mehtas, a family of
keen Internet surfers in Delhi,
have been acting strangely
after admitting “a tiny being”
into their home, it said.

The creature - known as
an inter-terrestrial, or IT -
speaks a language which
only the 12-year-old daugh-
ter of the house has mas-
tered.

“All that he says when
the Mehtas shake his hand
is: ‘Sneziten, loof lirpa’,” the
paper said.

“When Raheena tried to
decipher ‘Sneziten, loof lirpa’
by writing it down, she acci-
dentaily read it backwards.
Now, she smiles whenever
she sees her Netaholic par-
ents.”

FG moves to clean

he federal govern-
ment has concluded
plans to clean up the

three tier foreign exchange
market (Forex) in the coun-
try following the scam in-
volving 25 banks in the
Interbank Foreign Exchange
Market (IFEM).
Dependable sources
close to the government re-
vealed to Business Day that
government had been wor-
ried over the independence
of rates between the official
market and other currency
markets as was expressed by
President Olusegun
Obasanjo last week. But the
recent IFEM scam made a
radical change in the opera-
tions of the market impera-

bout four weeks af-
ter the Chairman,
oard of Directors

lof the Nigerian Ports Au-
thority (NPA), Chief
Olabode George ordered
some markerters to remove
iron-rods that litter the port,
causing an eyesore, these
marketers are yet to heed the
warning.

Investigations by Busi-
ness Day revealed that a hill
lof packed iron-rods are still
noticeable at sheds six, seven
and eight. It was gathered
from a reliable source that
lowners may not remove
them, because it is safe to
keep them in the port and it
costs less while pieces of
land to keep them are very

Alhaji Shehu Idris,

eign investors wishing to set

known while receiving the

scarce and expensive.

The owners would prefer
to keep them at the port
where they are safe and pay
just small amounts of money
and sell right at the port.

The source noted that
since these items have occu-
pied vast areas in the port, it
becomes difficult to move

,vehicles freely thereby re-
sulting in heavy traffic most
of the times.

Before, items like gen-
eral goods and personal ef-
fects were packed outside the
warehouse but now they are
lumped into the warehouse
directly from the vessels
which makes operations dif-
ficult.

Obasanjo maintained
that what shocked the gov-
ernment was the calibre
and number of banks that
were involved in the noto-
rious and illegal activity,
saying that almost all the
big banks in the country
were involved.

This situation, accord-
ing to him, is capable of
denting the image of the
country, as well as question
the accountability and
transparency policy of gov-
ernment.

merce who paid him a visit

he Managing Direc-
tor of the Nigerian

(NMC), Engr. Biodun
Olorunfemi has disclosed
the readiness of some
American companies to in-
vest in the nation’s solid
minerals sector by exploring
the abandoned deposits scat-
tered in some parts of the
country.

Speaking during a famil-
iarisation visit to the Corre-
spondents Chapel of the Ni-
geria Union of Journalists
(NUJ) in Plateau State,
Olorunfemi said already,
some American investors
including a team of engi-
neers and geologists are on
their way to the country.

land to foreign investors

West African Seasoning
Company Limited and rep-
resentative of Aji-No-Moto
Inc. Tokyo, Japan, Chief
Maurice Pagnon, who paid
him an official visit in Zaria.

He stated that the gesture
of the emirate council was
meant to promote rapid in-
dustrialisation of the area
and address the problem of
youth unemployment in
Kaduna State and the nation
in general.

He further explained that
Zaria which was well known
as an “educational city due
to the presence of many edu-
cational institutions in the
city, lacked industries,” and
called on the management of
Aji-No-Moto to avail itself of
this opportunity of acquiring
land to enable it establish a
branch of any of its subsidi-
aries in Zaria.

He assured that the emir-
ate council would continue

to support and encourage
investors whose intention
was to promote viable eco-
nomic activities in the coun-
try.

Earlier, Pagnon told the
Emir that Aji-No-Moto had
been in existence since 1909
while the Nigerian affiliate,
West African Seasoning
Company Limited, was es-
tablished in 1992.

“Ever since, the com-
pany has built a solid repu-
tation in the food and bever-
age sub-sector and its prod-
uct, Aji-No-Moto is a mar-
ket leading brand having a
sizeable market share in the
seasoning sector,” he said.

Pagnon further ex-
plained that Aji-No-Moto
which was being sold all
over the world was now be-
ing made through the fer-
mentation of sugarcane, “the
same process used in mak-
ing Akamu and Kunnu”.

Naira to bridge the widen-
ing gap between the official
and parallel market ex-
change rates.

However, before now, op-
erators have been crying
loud that the continued fall
in the exchange rate was be-
ing induced by the illegal ac-
tivities of some banks who
buy dollars at the rate of
N110 at IFEM and sell it at
black market or Bureau De
Change rate of N120 —
N135.

In other words, it has be-
come beneficial to them for
the Naira to continually lose
its value.

An analyst, Mr. Abiola
Sapper had told Business
Day earlier in the month that

some government officials,
the multi-nationals and
banks were involved in the
black market scam, stressing
that the nation’s economic
woos could be blamed on the
powers that be.

Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) spokesman, Tony
Ede last week disclosed that
the recent scandal started
upon discovery by the bank
that banks’ accounts were
not funded with Naira equity
values of their dollar bids.
Said he: “We discovered that
the banks accounts were in
the red”.

The scenario, according
to analysts suggests that the
banks collect dollars from
IFEM without paying for it

and trade it off at the black
market rate with a profit and
then return to the IFEM for
another bidding session.

Ede, however, disclosed
that the banks” suspension
for 10 IFEM days may just
be the punishment the CBN
will hand out in order not to
cause systemic failure since
many banks are involved in
the scam, given the fact that
an average of 30 banks par-
ticipate in each IFEM bid-
ding.

This he said is to avoid
a situation where more dis-
tress is generated in the al-
ready distrusted economy,
warning, however, that the
CBN would be more af-
firmative should such a
show of shame be repeated.

firms to invest in solid minerals

From Buhari Bello,
in Jos

According to him, the
decision of these companies
to invest in the country fol-
lowed publications on Ni-
gerian solid mineral depos-
its in international media.

Some of the mineral de-
posits, he said, include
Tantalite used in microchip
and computer production,
stressing that the U.S., Ja-
pan and China are the high-
est consumers of such de-
posits because they are the
major producers of compu-
ter accessories.

He repeated that over
two million dollars of these
materials now come into
Nigeria annually from

small and local investors at
the detriment of the nation’s
potential.

The managing director
also disclosed that the cor-
poration has embarked on
strategic planning to ensure
that the country benefits di-
rectly from such abundant
deposits.

He lamented that Nige-
rians “are busy talking about
oil and nobody computes the
amount of revenue accruing
to the nation through indus-
tries.

Commenting on the gold
deposits recently discovered
in Kebbi State, he said that
already, some foreigners
have already indicated inter-
est in investing in the sec-

tor, through a joint venture
with the government in the}
exploitation and exploration
of the mineral.

NITEL to digitalise Lafia|
exchange in June

he Minister of Com-
munications, Alba*
Mohammed -:rzika

has said that the
digitalisation and expansion
of Lafia exchange in
Nasarawa State will be com-
pleted in June.

Speaking when he paid
a courtesy visit to Governor
Abdullahi Adamu, the min-
ister, who had earlier in-
spected the digilisation
project, said that work on the
project was going on in ear-
nest.

Arzika, accompanied by
NITEL’s executive director
in charge of domestic net-
work, Dr. Suleiman Sani and
deputy general manager, Mr.
I. A. Sebanjo, said that the
exchange would be ex-
panded from the 500 ‘epilep-

tic’ ar_,ugue lines to 2,500
efficient digital lines.

He told the governor that
work on the digitalisation of

Abdullahi Adamu,
Nasarawa State Governor.

Keffi exchange would com-
mence as soon as the Lafia
exchange was inaugurated.

On post offices, Arzika
said that E-mail facility
would be provided in every
post office in the country,
adding that NIPOST now
carried mails daily and de-
livered them within 72
hours.

Responding, the gover-
nor assured the minister that
he would use the facilities of
information centres in the
state to enlighten the people
on the need for them to pat-
ronise NITEL and NIPOST.

He said he was desirous
that the state be linked to the
new fibre optic transmission
wiring, which he pointed
out, passed through the state
from the easterfi zone.

of Oasis Insurance Limited,
Lagos, Mr. Kayode
Durojaiye, who gave the ad-
vice, wondered why the
Naira keeps depreciating de-
spite the turnouts of revenue
accruals to Nigeria through
the sale of crude oil in the
international market.

The insurance expert
said “it is better imagined
than experienced, the way

in Abeokuta

depreciation leads to hyper-
inflation. Notwithstanding
CBN’s attempt to mop up
the excess liquidity, the ef-
fect has not been positive,
and this does not augur well
for the business and insur-
ance sectors”.

Speaking on the role of
insurance in a deregulated
economy, the chartered in-
surer said that more than
ever before, the role of in-
surance is “most-needed
now that there are lots of
risks to cover as occasioned
by the volume of investment.

“Insurance companies
are up to the challenge to

cover risk of Nigerian inves-
tors with qualified profes-
sionals manning all levels of|
services and security portfo-
lios.

Reacting on why private
insurance companies are
scrambling to cover govern-
ment investments with
NICON, Durojaiye ex-
plained that the fact that
government, especially at
the federal level is the larg-
est owner of properties,
makes it the target of insur-
ance companies to benefit
from insuring them, “hence
the movement of most insur-
ance companies to Abuja to
have a share in insuring gov-
ernment properties”.

last week will enable benefi-
ciaries access their cash in
any designated SGBN
branches and outlets 24

ment to the satisfaction of
the cash needs of Nigerians
after bank hours and during

that the offer was at tender
with the surging support ac-
corded the product since its
relaunch recently.

According to a statement
signed by the bank’s head of
Corporate Affairs, Mr.

Onyekdachi Nwosu, busi-
ness activities at all the
branches of the bank have
increased, showing that the
4TM card offer is going to
succes"! nationwide.

On the benefits of the
product, it stated that cus-
tomers do not need to carry
huge amounts of cash since
they can readily collect cash
any time of the day and that
customers can request for
cheque books through the

has awarded a
project specification con-
tract to the consortium of
Technip/Snampogetti/
Kellog Bown &amp; Root/JGC
(TSKJ) for the engineering
design and specification of
the “NLNG plus project”.

The general manager,
external relations of the
company, Ms. _ Siene
Allwell-Brown, said in a
statement in Lagos that “the
project is a two train expan-
sion of NLNG’s liquefied
natural gas (LNG) complex
at Finima on Bonny Island
in Rivers State.”

The project, which will
be completed before the end
of the year was awarded, fol-
lowing highly competitive
bidding and would provide
documentation for tender
engineering, procurement
and construction (EPC).

The EPC contract is to
be awarded in the first quar-

NLNG awards contract
for Finima expansion

ter of 2002 with start-up of
NLNG plus in mid-2005.

On completion of the
NLNG plus project, the
NLNG plant will have an
overall production capacity
of 16.7 million tonnes per
annum of LNG and two mil-
lion tonnes per annum of
LPG, it said, adding that it
will also utilise about 2,000
million standard cubic feet
per day of gas.

The managing director of
NLNG, Mr. Andrew
Jamieson, who signed on be-
half of the company, said
“the award of the project
specification contract for the
NLNG plus is a further dem-
onstration of the confidence
of NLNG’s shareholders in
the NLNG project and the
success of the Nigerian gov-
ernment in encouraging the

development of the Nigeria
gas industry”.

According to Jamieson.
the continued growth of the
NLNG project will enable the
export of larger amounts o
gas associated with oil pro-
ductions, which would oth
erwise have to be flared.

ow do you assess the PDP administration un
der President Olusegun Obasanjo?

The question you have asked is very important
I would say that as a party, we are generally
satisfied, because the President has performed well. We know
the depth from which we had to start, the effort at bringing
Nigeria back to limelight, to a position where one could have
confidence. So, one would see that in the context of the depth

where we are coming, the President has done well

The People’s Democratic Party seems to be embroiled
in one problem or the other. For now can you say with any
degree of authority that you have overcome them?

The dynamics of politics is such that you don’t expect a
big political party to be like a church sermon, where every
person present is sitting quietly listening to one preacher.
Politics is democracy where everybody likes his own ideas to
be brought forward, and there is always a struggle for su-
premacy or superior argument. you see the sort of agitation
constantly going on in a political situation. On the basis of
that, the size of PDP as compared with other political parties,
the amount of internal agitations that we have, certainly shows
that we are a virile party. | want to assure you that other
smaller parties do have problems much more than we have.
This is the bane of politics and you can’t run away from it.

Immediately after the last convention, some influential
members of your party, especially the Chief Sunday Awoniyi
group were not happy. What is the position of things now,
have you mended fences?

We have to a degree, but there still remain a few individu-
als who feel a personal loss of opportunity and have still not
given up and I don’t know if this dissatisfaction on their part
would be demonstrated in any further action.

But as far as we are concerned, most of the reconciliation
has been done and today, many who belong to that camp that
wanted to wrestle for leadership of the party and did not
succeed are working with us in the party. So, I don’t see any
reason why one should nét say that most of the problems of
disagreements have been settled.

How do you look at the issue of second term that is
currently creating confusion in your party?

I don’t think you are right. This is not an issue about my
second term. | am still in my first term of two years as national
Chairman. The question is that, we sought to amend the con-
stitution that the tenure of the national Executive of our party
should be four years, so that there would be less frequent
elections that lead to these long problems of reconciliation
that we have had to do, because in election year like 2003, we
would rather be concerned with public elections and general
elections where we have our candidates fighting against other
political parties. We have little or no time to talk about dis-
agreements between one group and the other, inside our party.
So, that was the wisdom of our party leadership in asking for
the amendment. There is no opposition to a four year term
and what is happening is that some people, out of mischief,
have brought about an interpretation of the motion, saying
that it is meant to extend the
tenure of the present Execu-
tive from two to four years,
that is not the issue. And if

“Everybody’s

 
 
   
   
  
  
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  

the argument that when the
motion was passed no date
was given, therefore they
presumed the originators of
the motion wanted to cover
those who are there. Why do
you presume something and
go ahead to take an action. It
is highly irresponsible really,
because their interpretation
is wrong. There is no motion

interest and aspiration would be

fashioned the way that satisfies everyone.
Now, the issue of resource control should
not be left for any single individual to
decide on. The issue is a national one
where all those concerned must be
allowed to play a part.”

extending my present tenure to four years. There is a motion
that extends the tenure inside the constitution of the National
Executive from two to four years. People are moving a counter
motion when there is no motion to that effect. I want to say
that it is all boiling down to the sentiments of some greedy
people who are so concerned about leadership, who must
fight to become leaders by all means, and who have found
hands that they can use. And once they take their money,
they move to justify such collections. You have counter-mo-
tions against motions that are in existence not those on pre-
sumptions. We do not have a motion extending my tenure.

Based on what you are saying non, it seems as if external
forces are at hand to work against you in the party?

It may not be out of place to say that, because in any
organisation there are always bad eggs. Jesus had 12 apostles
but there was only one Judas among them. That is to tell you
that even if you have just a dozen people you can have some
evil in it. Therefore it is not surprising to me that out of 137
members of the National Executive you can have two or three
that are behaving the way these ones are doing. The issue is
that this is a democracy, and as such when any issue is dis-
cussed, you have to mobilise your supporters to see reason
with your action. We have 3,200 (three thousand two hun-
dred) delegates coming to this convention, so they should go
there and convince those delegates to come and vote in the
particular way they want, not to go and start misinforming the
public by buying pages in the newspapers, and saying things
which do not happen. But in any case, these individuals who
are pioneering these problems, I mean the national publicity
secretary and his deputy are losers, who lost all their constitu-
encies in the last elections to the All Peoples- Party (APP).
Therefore, they have no reason to come and talk to us about
anything. If people who continue to cause trouble in the party
are those who contribute little or nothing to the party, how are
we going to take them seriously?

In our midst we have people who have produced over-
whelming results for PDP and they are not making trouble. So,
how can people who have produced nothing continue to make
trouble.

Recently, some members of this group you are talking
about accused you of marginalizing them in the scheme of
things, how far is this true?

There is no such thing as marginalisaion of any individual.
You see, there is always this strong element of greed in some
people and whenever any problem crops up, it is the same
people that are fielding it. It is their character, as there is nothing
wrong with the party. Why is it that when there is
marginalisation, it is the same set of people that are
marginalized? Why are they raising eyebrows, when in reality
these are the same set of people that are clamouring for the
extension of the tenure. I must say that the national publicity
secretary was at the centre of those who spearheaded the
motion for the extension of tenure. Because he himself
repeatedly said that when the next elections come, he would
not win because his states party machinery does not support
him.

What gimmick is this? I
know his problem is that he

voices likely to distract the attention of the National Chairman in
moving the party forward?

I have worked very hard to hold the party in unity. Even after the
National Convention in December 1999, we had quite a number of
people who were disgruntled. We wooed them into the party for a
very long time depending on their relevance. There are certain classes
of people you don’t have to lose sleep about. Especially this group
of Ibeshi and Olawepo. I don’t think I would waste time because at
the end of the day, they would add nothing to the victory of the
party. If I waste my time pursuing Ibeshi and Gbenga, did they
produce results before? Or are they likely to produce any in the
future? The answer is no.

So. Why should I bother myself if 1 am going to lose two people
out of 137,what is the concern? Why do you misbehave only to
come back and apologise. How many times has Gbenga done this?
On countless occasions, he would come back and misbehave again

and again. Just because somebody has a soft heart. The Constitution-

would take its normal course.

At the initial take off of the Obasanjo administration, there
was this disagreement between the Executive and the legislature.
How did you achieve peace between the two arms of government?

Well, it was mainly based on the disposition of the individuals
who were involved, and also the background of their relationships
based on the way the party established the government. My duty is
to ensure that I return things to the basics, first by ensuring that the
disposition of the leaders of both sides is that of cooperation and

Mantu as his deputy, things began to work positively such that
today, the harmony between the two arms of government has been
fully realised, even to the extent that the House of Representatives
has been affected.

Just within a year or two, your party had three Senate presidents.
Do you think that such developments are healthy for democracy?

It is indeed, and there is no problem with that at all, because
nobody was elected Senate President from his constituency. Every
one was elected as a Senator and the Primary role of such individual
in the National Assembly is their positidn and function senator.
The selection of leadership in the National Assembly is just a process

fe recently heard that the federal government had gone to court to

ince most of the Governors in these states are of the PDP, what is the
doing to resolve the problem?

f our party and at the national caucus where all parties are represented,
ound out that the federal government merely went to the Supreme
for the interpretation of the constitution and that is what the
tution says. If there is any disagreement in the way the constitution
irpreted, only the Supreme Court can give that interpretation. I have
se to disbelieve this. My idea is that when the Supreme Court has
that interpretation, we would always sit down and have political
ent on whatever contentious matter. I don’t think it is going to be a

handle internally.
es your party support resource control?
tional resource control is defined in the constitution of the federation,
ce that definition is given, its management is under the law governing
id. I believe that it becomes a delicate and complicated matter. You
say those who are agitating to have a say on how resources are
led that emanated from their land are wrong. You also cannot say that
ral government is wrong in saying that the constitution gives us
hority to oversee those resources. So, it is an issue, which must be

_at on the basis of how the constitution is writte ybody’s

 

. nal ISSUC —_Gemade

viewpoint must be translated into getting the National
Assembly to look at how the constitution is written. At the
end of the day every interest and aspiration would be satisfied,
if the constitution were fashioned the way that satisfies
everyone. Now, the issue of resource control should not be
left for any single individual to decide on. The issue is a national
one where all those concerned must be allowed to play a part.

How justified is the agitation for the Middle Belt region.

Nobody is agitating for a Middle Belt region. We have
passed the stage of creating regions in Nigeria as we are now
in the era of federating units moving closer as a strong,
indivisible Nigerian federation. These federating units are
states, but due to certain geo-political issues in our nation, we
are now defining in terms of Zones. People can have
aspirations, working as zones and this is what is happening in
Nigeria today, but I don’t think anybody is right in saying that
someone is agitating for a Middle Belt region. There are no
such agitations, but the aspiration as a people who belong to
this part of Nigeria, to do things together for their common
good is not out of place.

The under-50 group who are mainly from the PDP are
planning some political strategies towards 2003. What is
your reaction to this issue?

Well, this is happening generally throughout the world
where younger politicians are looking at their older counter
parts with mutual suspicions by saying that you guys have
been around for too long. The problem in Nigeria is that both
the old and the young politicians have not had the chance
because of Military intervention. My appeal is that they should
be fair to one another, The fact that Bill Clinton and Tony Blair
became leaders of big democracies at 40/42 does not mean
that we cannot do with over 50 years olds. Nobody is denying
anybody any position, after all majority of those who are
occupying key government positions in the country today are
the under 50s. I don’t think any body in the class of the
QSSea Ss oeally inking vf toming back again but if there is,

I would say it is going to be very tough but just below 50
alone will not be good enough. Even those who are above 50
and are active should be part of the game. Age is of the mind,
as some young people feel very old while old ones feel very
young, and as such we should be prepared to work together in
a way that Nigeria receives the maximum benefit of the talents
available.

How do you react to calls for new political parties to
challenge the PDP in the next round of elections?

That is not the purpose of anybody wanting the formation
of any political party. People who are asking for a chance to
form new political parties today, are only asking for privileges
and I don’t think in politics we should entertain such people.
When the rules of the game were laid down, people were given
the freedom to form political associations and then go to
elections so that they could convince Nigerians to vote for
them and Nigerians retused to vote for them. Today they sa;

a(fow new pofitical parties or register us. Register you... why?
When you have failed to get the votes. Those that were
registered because they succeeded in getting the Nigerian
votes. There should be no back door to move into those places.
If somebody wants to be a presidential candidate of his own
party, he must be told that he
has to go through Nigerians
to secure their votes. If you
want to form a political party
you must go to the polls and
win 10 percent of the votes
before you call yourself a

political party. Nobody
should bulldoze the
Independent Electoral

Commission INEC to come
and register a new party
without going through
elections.

Some people are having
misgivings on the
performance of your party
and they are afraid that 2003
might be different. How true
is this assumption?

Some of these people who
told you this must be the

Page 17

 

wrong Nigerians. A party that won over 64 percent of the
votes cast, and the election positions in Nigeria and which
has not lost a single bye-election before today. We have
won many Houses of Assembly in Niger State, Katsina and
Taraba. We won the federal House of Representatives in
Kaduna State and Local Government Chairman in Delta State.
How could somebody who sat in the comfort of his armchair
at home say this of the PDP.I think they are just speculating
about what is not going to happen.

Deregulation has been a contentious issue within the
Nigerian polity. Do you support deregulation?

Well, I have stated that people in labour and those who
are challenging deregulation should come up with alternative
suggestions. What is the point of telling somebody “don’t
do that” without telling him what next to do. PDP as a party
told the government to educate people on the virtues of
deregulation and also allow public opinion for and against it.
We want healthy dialogue and debate so that when decisions
are taken it would get the maximum support of the people.
The party’s position is that we do not want to jeopardise the
chances of any body in the debate on deregulation. We see
a lot of sense in what the pro-deregulation group are saying
by providing a lot of data and information on the matter and
most people today are convinced that there is some sense in
deregulation. We are yet to see the other side, and when we
see it, then a final decision would be taken on the matter.

If for any reason, Nigerians come to reject it. What
would your party do?

I don’t know what you mean.... How would you come to
conclusion that Nigerians have rejected it?

Like labour, civil servants, market women and the rest
kicking against it !

By my estimate, labour and the civil servants are only 6
percent of the Nigerian population. 1 am not saying they are
irrelevant, they are very important to us as a government.
The civil servants are also very important to Nigeria as a
country because one cannot do without the two. The workers
of the nation are fundamental to the movement of any
economy. So both groups are important but that does not
mean that they are speaking for Nigerians. Just because the
two groups have rejected a government policy does not mean
het Nigerians have rejected it. All of them together are not
more then 6-10 percent of the Nigerian population.

We heard recently that government shunned labour over
talks on deregulation. Are you comfortable with
governments’ explanation on the matter?

You heard it wrong. What happened is that the President
of Labour tried to hold a meeting with the President of the
country. I don’t think it is right for us to simplify issues and
just say in matters of this nature, it is the President of Labour
Versus the President of Nigeria. I think it is very unfair. The
government has a full complement of a Labour Ministry
which is very well suited in dealing with a situation of this
magnitude. Labour should discuss with the group in the min-
istry and iron out issues. They have been working hand in
hand . Adams Oshiomhole, the President of Labour has been
meeting government officials, here and there, and just be-
cause he did not have a mecting with the president does not

mean that Labour was shunned. We have seen certain coun-
tries where the President leads the delegation, while another
country leads its delegation with a minister. They still talk as
equals, so I don’t think we should over magnify those issues
by equating the President of Nigeria and that of labour.

Northern Yorubas warn

he Yoruba Commu

tion has called on elected
public officers to concentrate
lion implementing positive
programmes rather than dis-
sipating energy on the 2003
elections.

stream petroleum sector, the

Yoruba community wamed
against any plan to further
compound the already harsh
.economic reality in Nigeria.
The community which
met in Maiduguri, Borno
State, noted in a communiqué
signed by its President-Gen-
eral, Alhaji Ganiyu
Oguntoyimbo and issued in
Abuja, that Nigerians are se-

riously apprehensive on the

- adverse effect of the exercise

on their lives.

“Government should be
cautious in handling the mat-
ter (deregulation) in view of
its sensitivity,” they declared,
adding that in order to speed
up the process of national in-
tegration, unity and peaceful
co-existence, the clause on
non-indigenship be expunged
from the constitution.

 

FG approves rural telecommunication programme

Ts Federal Government has approved
atural telecommunication programme
to ensure that all local government
areas in the country are provided with
communication facilities within the next four
years.

The Minister of Communication, Alhaji
Mohammed Arzika, said this in Makurdi
when he paid a courtesy visit to the Benue
State Governor, Mr. George Akume.

Arzika said that under the programme, 120
local government areas would be made ac-
cessible to telecommunication this year while
400 local government areas would be pro-
vided with communication facilities next
year.

He expressed optimism that before the
year 2005, all parts of the country would ben-
efit from the telecommunication programme.

The minister also said that under the de-
regulation of the telecommunication sector,
the federal, state and local government areas
would contribute to subsidise the rural tele-
communication project.

Arzika promised Nigerians improved tele-
communication services, adding that contracts
would soon be awarded for the digitalisation
of the telephone exchange in Gboko town of
Benue State.

Receiving the minister, governor Akume
urged the Federal Government to give prior-
ity to the state in telecommunication devel-
opment since the state is 75 per cent rural.

Akume also called for the provision of
new telephone lines in Makurdi, Gboko and
Vandeikya to enhance communication in the
state.

Jigawa legislators dissolve pilgrims board

motion directing the executive arm of the
state government to dissolve the state’s
Pilgrims Welfare Board.

This directive is contained in a motion
jointly sponsored by Hon. Rabi’u Dangabi
Kwalam (Taura) and Alhaji Isa Alhasan
Korayal (Gwiwa). They demanded that the
board as well as the management be dissolved
and suspended pending the outcome of an
investigation into their affairs.

Supporting the motion, Hon. Umar Anas
Adamu (Malammadori), said that any com-
mittee set up to investigate the matter must
have a free hand to go to any extent so as not
to cripple the outcome of the investigation in
order for truth to take its rightful position.

The house finally appointed a committee

J igawa State legislators have passed a

are Hon. Ibrahim Babura (Babura) chairman,

member. Others, are Hon. Umar Anas Adamu
member, Hon. Rabi’u Dangabi Kwalam

Mohammed will be the secretary to the com-
mittee.

It will be recalled that pilgrims from
Jigawa State suffered untold hardships before,
during and after this year’s hajj due to the al-
leged misconduct of the members of the
state’s pilgrims welfare board.

Nigeria, ALSCON,

resident Olusegun
Obasanjo has called
on the private sector

and technology consultants
to provide necessary training
and assistance for Nigerian
small scale industries seeking
to benefit from electronic
communication.

The president who was
speaking at the opening
ceremony of NIGERSTALG
Trade Fair in Abuja, assured
Nigerians that government
was “genuinely sincere in its
pursuit of economic program-
mes and policies that would
create the required capacities
for a people-centred techno-
logical development”. 4

He said the development
of the internet as a way of
faster business communica-
tion can no longer be ignored.

Represented at the fair by
the Minister of Federal
Capital Territory, Engr.
Muhammed Abba-Gana,
President Obasanjo said the
INIGERSTALG fair was aimed
at facilitating the partici-
pation of micro, small and
medium scale enterprises in
the trade and teurism
sectors.

He assured Nigerians that
government will continue to
pursue its role of formulating
national objectives for good
governance and develop-
ment by establishing sound
economic policies and
favourable investment
regimes.

However, he said, the
private sector and other
stakeholders in the industry
must join hands to support
fand sustain go\ernment
efforts.

Mr. Okoro, who is the
manager, Ijora district in
Lagos state, stated this at the
customers consultative
council meeting where he
disclosed that the district
was owed 1.542 billion naira
as at February this year by
government and private
consumers.

The district manager,
however, said that NEPA has
set up a special task force to
disconnect all debtor-
customers in order to recover
the huge debt.

He also observed that
vandalisation of cables,
illegal connections among
others were becoming more
worrisome, noting that these
activities adversely affect the
equipment and cause
instability in supply to
customers.

Mr. Okoro said the
district had 700 transformers,
but requires 200 more to
solve the present low-level
supply being witnessed by
customers.

According to him, 82
transformers of the
transformers in the district
were overloaded which
necessitated local load-
shedding to save them from
packing-up completely.

We’ve no reason to im

lhaji Saleh Bade,

Managing Director/

Chief Executive Of-
ficer of Salba Nigeria Lim-
ited, was a former senatorial
candidate for Yobe-North
Senatorial District under the
defunct National Republican
Convention (NRC). Accord-
ing to him, he left banking in-
dustry to answer the calls of
his people to represent them
in the 3rd Republic’s Senate.

Now a big time farmer in
Kaduna and a politician, he
bares his mind on burning
national issues in a chat with
DARE OYEWOLE in
Kaduna. Saleh, who serves
on the Agriculture Commit-
tee of the Arewa Consultative
Forum (ACF), laments the
neglect of agriculture and ad-
vocates that legislators at all
levels be made to have farms.
Excerpts:

Lets start from
agriculture. The country was
said to have spent N900
million to import food, and
farmers are criticising this as
they argue that it ought to
have gone into investment in
agriculture rather than
importation. What is your
view on this?

You see, in this country
we have a problem. One, we
talk of policies and their
implementation. There are
policies that are laudable, very
good, in their context; the
problem is that when you
come to implement these poli-
cies, so many things do go
wrong.

You have a country like
Nigeria; we are not Saudi
Arabia, we are the country that
is blessed. There is no part in
this country that when you
plant things they will not
grow. There is no reason
whatsoever why we should
now be importing food. Agri-
culture has been neglected.
You can see from the
Obasanjo’s budget this year
they are talking of N7 billion.
If there is anything that can
take a lion’s share, agriculture
is supposed to be one of them.
Because when you produce,
you now reduce the suffering
of the masses. All these prob-
lems of street begging, even
the insecurity you are talking
about. People are insecure be-
cause they cannot afford to
feed themselves. They cannot.
Today, with their N5,000 even.
if you are earning the mini-
mum wage they are talking
about. A bag of maize is over
two thousand Naira. And they
are thinking that somebody
should now feed his family
with the N5,000. I think we
have a problem. Our problem
is that there are people who
don’t advise the government
in the right direction. But
rather, they advise the govern-
ment for their own interest be-
cause if somebody is going to
import things, an interest is
there. That’s it.

Look, there was a time I
was wondering why the law-
makers cannot legislate a law
making it compulsory for ev-
ery elected member at all lev-
els to have a farm. If from
councillor to chairman, legis-
lature and the executive, if
each and every one of these

people would have a farm, you
can imagine how many people
you are going to engage in
farming. That will reduce the
problem of unemployment
and boost the issue of food
production. So, I would advise
that al] our legislators at all
levels should legislate, from
local government councillors
even to the president himself,
they should have farms. You
see, once there is food secu-
rity, there is security. That is
why you hear cases of armed
robbery increasing on daily
basis. What are they after;
they are just after money to go
and eat. So, the issue of im-
porting food. ...As I men-
tioned earlier, Saudi Arabia is
a dry land, they only have
rainfall may be twice or thrice
in a season. But a country like
Nigeria still has to import
food. What are we importing?.
Why do we even invest that
money on importation when
we budgeted only N7 billion
for agriculture, why can’t we
add the money we used on
importation with the budget
for the sector to encourage
Nigerian farmers. So, for me, I
am against importation of
food into the country.

What do you think should
be the approach of govern-
ment in checking possible
famine?

Yes, you see, if we are
talking about famine; I think
government said last year that
they bought a lot of grains. I
think the purpose of buying
these grains is to intervene
when there is famine. So, we
expect that what they pur-
achased last year will be
enough to, at least, augment
what the farmers may produce
at the end of the season. Sec-
ondly, we have to pray to Al-
{ah to let it (famine) come with
very little impact if at all it
does come. Because, I remem-
ber when we experienced fam-
ine in 1993. Not only human
beings even the animals were
also dying because there was
no grass to feed them. So, I
believe government should
use what they have in store.
But definitely I am not going
to vote for importation of food
into this country. We are not
serious in this country. If we
are serious, even the Chinese
don’t import food despite the
fact that they are 1.2b. And yet
Yhey are feeding themselves.
So, government should al-
ways consider that agriculture
is very important. They should
also encourage people, every-
body even you (journalist) to
have small farms.

You are a member of the
Committee on Agriculture of
the Arewa Consultative Fo-
rum (ACF), whatis the focus
of that Committee?

That Committee is just as
I said. In fact, I am not talking
on behalf of the committee.
But what I just want to tell you
is that the Committee was set
up to look into the problems
facing agriculture in the
Northern states. It may be
applicable to any other part of
the country. But I believe
whatever ACF would be
coming out with can be spread

to other parts of the country.
So. the main thing we sre

going to look into is how do
we get out of this dependency
on petroleum. The Committee
is going to look at ways of
encouraging people to come
back to agriculture. You need
to sensitise the people and let
them be agriculture-friendly.
So, that is what that
committee is trying to come
out with. But am not speaking
on behalf of the Committee.
President Olusegun
Obasanjo is a member of the
farming family. Does it
bother you that he is not
doing much for that family?
In fact, I have been hear-

 

Alhaji Saleh Bade

ing about Otta Farm, but I
have never been there. But
definitely, what I know is that
whether you are a retired gen-
eral or an ex- Head of State, if
you are into farming, what-
ever it is does not bother any-
body. We are happy with
Obasanjo having that kind of
project (Otta Farm). Because
he is setting a kind of prece-
dent for these people that have
retired. If General Ibrahim
Babangida would do the same
thing in the North, you can
imagine how many people he
would engage in Minna. If
Shagari is going to do the
same. Gowon and the rest of
these people.

Look, we are not serious.
Our people have the money.
All these military guys have
the money, but they don’t
want to go to farm. That’s our
problem. They don’t want to
go to farm. I can assure you
that most of them can employ
two to three hundred people
on their land. If we are seri-
ous why not. But they prefer
to go and invest in foreign
companies. In fact, this atti-
tude is negatively affecting
Nigeria because there is no
benefit to us. When you take
Nigerians money abroad, you
are not helping Nigeria. Invest
this money here. How many
ex-governors do we have? We
have all these people. So, if
they are serious, let them

come back to farming so that
thew can hale thalenamensn!

 

ties.

What is your view on the
one term of office recom-
mended by the Constitutional
Review Committee?

Yes, you see, it is not too
bad when they are recom-
mending one term of five
years. But the problem is that
this democracy is a nascent de-
mocracy. We are just crawling
like a child. To my mind, it is
not going to be too bad if we
can allow this one term of five
years to continue for a mini-
mum period of time. The rea-
son being that there are a lot
of people who are not politi-

    

cians but were lucky because
of their money and got elected
into offices. Now, if you elect
somebody because of his
money and he is not doing
well, the more you prolong his
term, the more you cause
problem for him and his
people. I think four years is
enough to serve and make
positive impact. I am not in
support of five years, let it be
one term of four years.

Would you say there is a
need for a National Confer-
ence?

When you have elected
members at various levels that
can take care of the problems
of the people, what sort of con-
ference are you talking
about? Take your problems to
the National Assembly. They
are representing us.

I think those who are nur-
turing this constitutional con-
ference at this point in time
want to disintegrate the nation.
If they are not after disintegra-
tion and they are after unity
and reconciliation, it could
have been better. There is no
need for any National Confer-
ence either sovereign or in
whatever guise because the
representatives of the people
at various levels can ad-
equately take care of any prob-
lem.

What about the -citation

for resource controt?

There are pesple +..0
think that becaus. certain

ais ‘

port food

cality, they are suppose to
control it. Though there is is-
sue of off-shore and on-shore
resource control, some people
forget that there is internation-
ally accepted standard which
you cannot change just like
that. | think it is too early for
Nigerians to start talking
about resource control. Be-
cause it is like when you go
hunting, all of you suffer your
own suffering, you are thirsty,
then one man happens to have
water in a small container and
after drinking small quantity
claims he is the owner of the
water. So, I can give you
people since am controlling
the water, what | feel, I will
give out. For now, let us live
collectively. Iam 100 percent
in support of developing those
areas which, in fact, for years,
have been neglected. But at
the same time let us think
about Nigeria first. Let us for-
get about claiming that this
one is from my side, that one
is from your side. Who told
you that there is no oil in my
state (Yobe) or in Bauchi? But
today if we tap oil in Bauchi,
Bauchi people cannot say it is
for only Bauchi people. Don’t
forget that all these things are
given by God. And God is
wonderful, He can change
anything entirely.

Even now, Chad Republic
and Cameroon have discov-
ered oi] around Lake Chad
and they will start exploration
very soon. Look at the map of
Nigeria, that Lake Chad is a
kind of joint where Nigeria
has its own share, Cameroon
has its own and Republic of
Chad also has its own. Now
Cameroon said they have
found it (fuel) but Nigeria says
they haven’t got it.

Is that politics?

Of course. Everything is
political. Even the Bauchi is-
sue. Now yesterday I read in
one of the newspapers that
government is going to look
into the gas project in Bauchi.
But the issue is that it is not
our problem. Let these things
be found anywhere in the
country and let us develop. If
you travel out you will be dis-
appointed over what is hap-
pening in Nigeria as most of
the countries that had nothing
before have developed more
than Nigeria that have every-
thing you can think of. Just
take for an example, oi! was
discovered in Nigeria; Nige-
ria is a member of OPEC,
Saudi Arabia is a member of
OPEC, when Nigeria started
growing that time, Saudi had
not found its feet. Despite the
fact that we have the oil, Saudi
has overtaken Nigeria.

The poorest man in Saudi
must eat chicken and egg.
Somebody who is sweeping
can go to big time restaurant
to eat. Can this happen here
despite the fact that we have
the resources? Our problem is
that our leaders are not hon-
est. We are not honest. Every-
body when he comes to power
will be telling you stories and
promises but when it comes to
implementation, they are

_.ehg to write home about.
At the end of the day it is the

these rich men will pack and
go abroad. Some of them
don’t even have their families
in Nigeria. In the face of small
problém they pack and go.
They have their houses there,
their children are there. It is
you and | that suffer. Go tomy
village, for weeks you will not
see light, least of all, potable
water.

Talking about poverty
alleviation, how can you
alleviate poverty with the
necessary infrastructures not
in place? The government is
bent on deregulating the
petroleum sector in spite of
protests from the masses. Is
it fair to further increase
their burden?

Well, ifderegulation...you
see, it all depends on the goals
and objectives of the
programme. If the objective
of deregulation is going to
bring the present suffering
facing us in Nigeria down, it
is okay with us. But let me tell
you, don’t forget Nigerian
characters. You can deregu-
late today, and at the same
time people will inflate the
prices of the product same
day. And by the time the offi-
cial price goes up to may be
N50.00 per litre or N100 per
litre, let me tell you, we
bought all the Tokunbo cars
when we bought them because
we had the opportunity cost.
You either go for this or that
or you forget it. If your whole
salary will fuel your car before
you can go out, you either for-
get the car and start trekking.
So, deregulation, if the objec-
tive is to better our lot, let it
be.

You see, | am disap-
pointed when I heard the Min-
ister of Information on the
Voice of America last week
saying that they know those
behind the perennial scarcity
of fuel and that they are going
to deal with them. I am disap-
pointed, because I don’t know
why it should take them such
a long time to deal with them
since they know them. Now
that they know those behind
the problem, why do we need
to deregulate again? If they are
serious about dealing with
those responsible, why do we
need deregulation? You know
the cause of your problen If
you know your problem wi v
are you talking about anoth -
thing again? If you don
know the problem, you can
now talk about deregulatior
so that we can solve the prob
lem. But the issue is that the
know these people that a =
causing this wahala. Arte Jt
them, deal with them anc let
the fuel be available « ‘ery

The government s argu-
ing that workers sal.ries had

enator Wahab
Dosumu has declared
his readiness to chal-

lenge Govemor Bola Tinubu
in the 2003 Lagos state gov-
ernorship election.

The Senator, who dis-
closed this in a chat with
Daily Trust, however, gave a
condition that would make
him go to the polls with the
incumbent.

According to him, he
would challenge Tinubu if
the current clamour for his
candidacy continues un-
abated.

“As I have said before,
2003 election is still far away
and I’m working hard on be-

Hon. Chibudom Nwuche and Senator Stella Omu, at the Ibori Vanguard Lecture on Resource
Control and True Federalism held at Sheraton hotel s and towers, Abuja... recently

Lagos

 

ing a good Senator. But if
Lagosians want me I will not
decline to serve,” he said.

It would be recalled that
there have been clamours of
recent that the next governor
of Lagos state should be an
indigene as the present one
is said to hail from Osun state.

This clamour, being spon-
sored by Lagos indigenes,
maintains that Lagosians are
being marginalized in all
spheres of governance and
that their demarginalization
should commence with their
producing the next governor
of the state.

 
   
 

With Tinubu's certificate
scandal, people are begin-
ning to point at Dosumu as
the next Alliance for Democ-
racy (AD) governorship can-
didate since Funso Williams,
who was formerly consid-
ered as a good replacement
for Tinubu, has joined the
Peoples Democratic Party
(PDP).

Furthermore, it is felt that
the Afenifere, who are pres-
ently at loggerheads with the
Tinubu camp, may opt for
Dosumu.

Dosumu, however, told
us that this ambition to rule
Lagos is not a do or die af-
fair, because he is a democrat

Katsina assembly
probe petition

he Katsina State
House of Assembly
has directed its

committee on religious af-
fairs to investigate a peti-

lernment of being reluctant
to implement the signed
Shari’ a legal system in the
state.

Sponsoring the motion,
Barrister Abdulkadir Lawal,
representing Musawa Con-
Istituency, said that the ini-
tial zeal as a result of the
Shari’ a introduction re-
sulted in high decline in
criminal activities in the
state, but the continued de-
lay in the proper implemen-
tation of the Shari’ a legal

given people with criminal
minds the liberty to unleash
havoc in the state un-

He told the assembly
that even prosecutions in

He added that the Shari’

the state government are not
qualified to head the Shari’

Another legislator, Sani
Inusa, representing Jibia

enough evidence abounded
to show serious sabotage in

He, therefore, urged the
house to allow the relevant

for INEC

he Alliance for De-
mocracy (AD) has
concluded arrange-

ments to send a bill seeking
financial autonomy for the
Independent National Elec-
toral Commission (INEC).

The bill, according to its
sponsor, if passed by the
National Assembly, will en-
able INEC to perform its obli-
gations as a truly unbiased
umpire.

Already, in the true spirit

Besides, he maintained “it
is too early for one to be pre-
occupied with that (gover-
norship campaign). It is too
early right now to start jun-
keting for any position.”

AD proposes bill on autonomy

By Tashikalmah Hatlah |

of bipartisanship, the party
has stretched out its arms to
the other two registered po-
litical parties, All People’s
Party (APP) and the People’s
Democratic Party (PDP) for
consultations in support of
the bill.

Also, the proposed bill,
according to Reverend Tony
Mamzo Abubakar and
Opeyemi Bamidele, Deputy
National Publicity Secretary
and Director of Research and
Publicity respectively will,
among other things, ensure
the financial autonomy of the

_electoral body such that its

expenditure will be charged
directly on the consolidated
revenue fund of the Federa-
tion.

In their words: “The pur-
pose of the bill is to ensure

Tuesday, April 3, 2001

    
  
 

that the INEC has a free hand
to conduct future elections
independently of the whims
and caprices of which ever
political party is in power and
concomitantly deepen the
democratic content in the
operationalization of INEC.”

The sudden position of
the party (AD) is precipitated
by the fear of possible con-
trol of the INEC by the gov-
ernment as one of its
parastatals which may also
lead to a possible political
manipulation (rigging) in the
forthcoming national elec-
tions.

The party added that its
position is consistent with
the party’s political philoso-
phy of ensuring sustainable,
truly federalist, multiparty
democracy in the Nigerian

polity.

APP set to resolve Kwara crisis

ll the warring par-
ties in the
intra-party crisis
rocking the All People’s
Party (APP) in Kwara state
would be carried along to
ensure speedy reconcilia-
tion and genuine peace.
The chairman of the
APP Caretaker Committee,
Hon. Fidel Ayogu, ap-
pointed by the national
headquarters of the party
for Kwara State, made the
pledge during a visit to the
state governor, Alhaji
Muhammed Lawal, in

he chairman, Lagos
Mainland Local Gov-
emment, Lagos State,
Alhaji Boshri Bolarinwa, has
described the constitutional
provision of a two-year ten-
ure for council chairmen in
the country a belated military
agenda.

Speaking to Daily Trust
in his office at the weekend,
Alhaji Bolarinwa urged the
Federal Government and the
National Assembly to stop
implementing belated ideas
of the military and “look for
something new to give our
young democracy.”

Bolarinwa, who chal-
lenged the Federal Govern-
ment to tel] the entire coun-
try why local government
chairmen should not serve
for four years, just like other
tiers of government, re-
minded both the Federal and
state governments that
“those who voted for them
also did the same to the local
government chairmen.”

He said the idea of the
two- year tenve for local

over government to the civil-
ians. “So, to be on the safe
side, they used local govern-
ment election as a face-sav-
ing strategy,” he alleged.

Bolarinwa, who said local
government chairmen were
elected for the same purpose
the state governors, Na-
tional Assemblies, State As-
semblies and the President
were elected, asked why they
should be treated differently?

On the crisis rocking the
Alliance for Democracy (AD)
in Lagos State, Bolarinwa,
who was elected on the
party’s platform said that,
“Alliance for Democracy in
Lagos Mainland Local Gov-
ernment Area and, indeed,
Lagos state is intact.”

He told Daily Trust that
the current monthly AD uni-
fication meetings were an in-
dication of unity in the party.
Bolarinwa revealed that the
meetings would foster a
good relationship among
party members.

He appealed to the war-
ring parties to give the com-
mittee a chance to function
in order to bring about a
new lease of life in the
party.

The committee was put
in place following the dis-
solution of the state execu-
tive committee of the party
by the national secretariat
on March 19, 2001, after a
protracted crisis which led
to the removal of the
former chairman of the

to confirm and give indica-
tion that AD is and will con-
tinue to wax stronger in the
leadership of present and fu-
ture politics in the Lagos
Mainland Local Government
Area, Lagos State and be-
yond,” he said.

Commenting on the stress
in getting certificates of ori-
gin, Bolarinwa said all they
do at the loca! council level
was to request from the ap-
plicant his/her clearance cer-
tificate or a letter from the
Bale or Oba of his area of resi-
dence. “Once that is pre-
sented and we find out that
it is not forged, of course we
issue the person with the
certificate of origin of the lo-
cal government.

Asked if there has been
any recorded incident of forg-
ery of documents by any ap-
plicant for certificate of ori-
gin in the local government,
he answered in the negative
and added “I’m not even the
person that signs such docu-
ments. There are officers
around me that do that but

no such incident has

some aggrieved members
of the party.

Hon. Ayogu said the
committee has three
months within which to
oversee the affairs of the
party in the state, restore
peace and supervise the
emergence of a new execu-
tive through a free and fair
election.

He said the committee
had already visited the
INEC, the state police com-
missioner and the former
party chairman, Professor
Ogunshola, who made
positive comments about
the performance of the state
government in its efforts
aimed at improving the
socio-economic life of the
people.

Responding, the gover-
nor assured the committee
of his readiness to assist it
in the successful execution
of its assignment, and com-
mended the initiative of the
committee in contacting the
leadership of the party on
ways of resolving the intra-
party crisis in the state.

He particularly com-
mended the committee for
contacting Dr. Olusola
Saraki through his personal
assistant, noting that Dr.
Saraki was the only leader
of the party in the state and
the country at large.

expressed satisfaction with
the steps taken so far by the
committee opined that they
would go a long way in

Rep decries

 

Federal Medical Centre

he Deputy Chairman
| of the House of
Representatives
Committee on Health, Hon.
Shehu Usman Aliyu, has
expressed concern over the
reluctance of the Jigawa State
government to relinquish the
former Birnin-Kudu general
hospital, now Birnin-Kudu
Federal Medical Centre to the
Federal Government, a
situation which he said has
made the centre dormant.

The Birnin-Kudu centre
is one of the general hospi-
tals recently converted into
federal medical centres by
the Federal] Government to
ensure the provision of ad-
equate funding and medical
facilities, in order to meet the
FG’s target of achieving
health for all Nigerians by the
year 2010.

Speaking exclusively to
Daily Trust at the end of the
Senate and House Commit-
tees’ public hearing on
NAFDAC and fake drugs,
Shehu noted with concern,
the state of activities in the
Birnin-Kudu medical centre
which he said is “virtually
dormant,” while some of the
recently converted federal
medical centres like that of
Keffi in Nasarawa State are
“fastly developing.”

The health committee
deputy chairman said he was
reliably informed “by some
senior staff. of the Birnin-

Kudu Federal Medical Cen-
tre,” who would not want
their names in print for obvi-
ous reasons, that “virtually
nothing happens at the cen-
tre in view of the Jigawa State
government’s recalcitrant
stand over the conversion of
the hospital to a federal medi-
cal centre.”

Shehu, who represents
Karaye/Rogo Federal Con-
stituency of Kano State won-
dered what informed the
Jigawa State government’s
decision not to relinquish the
hospital, “even when it can-

not adequately fund and
maintain the hospital.” He
regretted that while several
communities were lobbying
for their hospitals to be taken
over by the Federal Govern-
ment, the Jigawa government
was depriving its people of
good medical care, stressing
that “this is detrimental to not
only the entire people of the
state, but the North at large.”

He urged the Jigawa State
government to reconsider its
position and pave way for the
development of the medical
centre, stressing that as a leg-
islator, “I know what it takes
to convince the executive
arm of the government to

According to him, al-
though HIV/AIDS is mainly
contracted through sexual in-
tercourse, a great number of
people get infested through
other means, “such people
need a cure for the ailment,”
he said.

Furthermore, the doctor
said those who claim there
was no cure for AIDS are
those who do not want to

 

ge for AIDS patients

recognise those who have
the cure.

He argued that while
pharmaceutical companies in
Europe have been able to get
AIDS management drugs,
which only lead one slowly
to eventual death, his own
drug can completely cure the
killer disease.

He launched a sticker
with the words “AIDS KILLS.
PASS THE MESSAGE.
DON’T PASS THE VI-

  

RUSES” made by the Na-
tional Youth Association
with the sum of One hundred
thousand naira.

He praised the members
of the association for being
on the vanguard of the cam-
paign against the spread of
the HIV/AIDS infection.

Dr. Abdullahi is one of
the claimants to possessing
a vaccine for the cure of HIV/
AIDS.

Herbalist blames orthodox

doctors for neglect

herbal practitioner
with Prince Trado-
edical Clinic, Idu,

Abuja, Dr. Bayo Etete, has
blamed the neglect of tradi-
tional medicine practitioners
on orthodox doctors at the
Ministry of Health.

Such doctors at the health
ministry, Dr. Etete said were
afraid that giving recognition
to natural medicine would
affect their own profession.

“But this is not true. It is
good they begin to recognise
our herbs as is being done in
some developed countries,”
he said.

He said herbs were pre-
ferred by people because
they “contain vitamins, min-

n agreement to
produce LAPDAP,
anew treatment for

malaria, has been signed
between the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and
Glaxosmithkline, one of the
world’s leading pharma-
ceutical companies.

The WHO said in a press
release made available to the
News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN), in Lagos at the
weekend that “LAPDAP, a
product that combines two
existing anti-malaria
compounds, Chlorpro-
guaniland Dapsone, is a
Potential life-saving medi-
cine.”

According to the release,
the aim of the agreement is
to develop LAPDAP as an
effective oral treatment for
uncomplicated malaria,
primarily for use in sub-
Saharan Africa, but also in
other regions of the world
where it may be appropriate.

“To date, clinical trials in
sub-Saharan Africa have
demonstrated that LAPDAP
is effective in the treatment
of uncomplicated malaria
resistant to other standard
first line therapies such as
chloroquine and sulpha-
doxine/pvrimethamine (SP»”

erals and other nutrients that
nourish and build the body
systems.”

He also said that herbs
“cleanse and purify the body
system without side effects.”

Speaking on the precau-
tions taken by their clinic to
provide herbal drugs free
from contamination, Dr. Etete
said Prince Tradomedical
Clinic has a department spe-
cially carved out for the
preparation of herbal drugs.

“The section is up to stan-
dard as far as herbal medicine
is concerned. But believe it
or not, Orthodox medical
doctors may want to set their
own standards,” he said.

He revealed that the clinic

It said that LAPDAP
would be made available at a
preferential price for public
health programmes, adding
that the medicine was already
entering its final phase of
development and could be
available in some African
countries by early next year.

Malaria is a serious,
sometimes fatal, disease. At
least 300 million malaria
clinical cases occur
worldwide every year, 90
percent of which are in
Africa.

It is believed that close to
3,000 people, mostly children
under five, die as a result of
the disease every day. (NAN)

Computerised
medical care

T= largest restructuring of
hospitals ever carried out
in Europe has just been
completed in Paris. The new
European Georges-Pompidou
hospital, in the South-west of
the capital, has been
accommodating the activities of
three Paris hospitals, Broussais,
Laennec and Boucicault, over
the second half of the year 2000.
The patients were the last to join
this “high tech” structure
characterised by the widespread

 

uses quality herbs. “These
herbs have names. We there-
fore direct our accredited
suppliers to look for this or
that herb that we need them,”
he said.

He also revealed that
some states already had tra-
ditional medicine boards
which regulate activities of
natural medicine practitio-
ners in their states and be-
rated the’Ministry of Health
for paying lip service to the
issue of a regulatory body.

“Though quackery is
widespread. It is found in
every profession, not only in
the area of traditional medi-
cine but we believe that an
agency would help regulate
who is who,” he said.

He called for a means of
testing people who claim to
have the cure for certain dis-
eases by allowing their tradi-
tional herbal mixtures to be
administered on patients. He
claimed that traditional medi-
cine is acquired by appren-
ticeship or inherited from par-
ents as gift of nature.

Explaining the issue of
expiry dates for herbal mix-
tures, Dr. Etete said because
the herbs were natural and
not chemically treated they
tend to last for a very long
time.

“Once they are preserved
either by drying, boiling, etc
they tend to last for a very
long time. We all grew up from
homes where our mothers
store roots for use for treat-
ing minor ailments in the fam-
ily, you don’t hear that such
roots expire unless some-
thing goes wrong,” he said.

He dismissed the noise
about expiry dates of herbs,
saying because they are pre-
served naturally some of
them are just as effective as
they were the day they were
plucked from the shrubs.

He called on people to
discard the use of herbs with
alcohol saying it was not ad-
visable.

Zimbabwe’s tourist industry

imbabwe’s tourism Industry

/ has not recovered from the

bad publicity that started af-

fecting the country in the run-up to

the parliament elections last June,

according to the Zimbabwe Coun-
cil for Tourism (ZCT).

ZCT Chief Executive Elias
INyakunu told Zimbabwe News
Agency (ZIANA) on Saturday that
the situation, which was expected to
recover this year, was not showed
any signs of doing so.

“The situation is still as bad I
don’t see any silver lining in the sky.
There is nothing positive at the mo-
ment,” he said, adding that he was

also worried by the fact that Air Zim-
babwe had been making amend-
ments to its flight schedule.

According to Nyakunu, more
then 100 tourism operators face clo-
sure before the second half of the
year and more than 60 are said to
have closed down last year.

The number of those purported
to have closed down could be more
than as many small tour operators
were not registered with the Zim-
babwe tourism Authority, he said.

Zimbabwe’s image as a Prime
tourist destination suffered a major
blow with the start of violence,
which accompanied the run-up to

the elections last June.

Tourist arrivals, which grew by
eight percent from 2.09 million in
1995 to 2.25 million in 1999, de-
clined by more than 60 percent last
year, Nyakunu said.

Last July, President Robert
Mugabe launched the tourism recov-
ery plan aimed at boosting the
country’s tourism industry by restor-
ing international confidence in Zim-
babwe as a safe destination.

Anenvironment and tourism task
force was set up through the National
Economic Consultative Forum to
come up with a recovery plan. How-
ever, the plan has not yielded fruits.

Arroyo opens palace to the people

Arroyo opened her residence under
a scheme to make it more acces-
sible.

“The weekly event is meant to
turn Malacanang into a true palace
of the people.” A palace statement
said.

Entire families carrying picnic
baskets unrolled mats on the tree-
shaded lawns and children romped
on the ground while a band played
music to mark the launching of
Arroyo’s project, dubbed “Sundays
in Malacanang (palace) Gardens.”
“Tt looks like they’re having a birth-
day party,” Arroyo said after min-
gling with the crowds, Groups and
danced on a makeshift stage to en-
tertain the visitors.

A government technology
agency set up a booth to show how
soap was made while other groups
hawked food from stalls. An ice
cream man went around with his

  
   
    
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
 

wares.

Teams of doctors and dentists
treated some 400 people with vari-
ous complaints free of charge.

The palace complex is normally
of-limits to ordinary people unless
they have official business to trans-
act.

In the late 1980s,then President
Corazon Aquino also opened the
palace to the people, including for-
eign tourists, to display more then
1,200 pairs of shoes collected by ex-
first lady Imelda Marcos during the
rule of her late husband, Ferdinand
Marcos.

Aquino said the shoes, aban-
doned at the palace when the
Marcoses fled the country during a
popular revolt, which toppled them
from power in 1986, symbolised
government excesses during the
Marcos regime.

Echoes of sweet

M:::= sounds

within, it
grows and becomes alive in every
one-if only he can draw it. Everything
in creation, including music has har-
mony and rhythm. As long as it flows
from above, it surely flows in har-
mony.

It is sad that today in our society,
true music has died away. It is not
what it used to be before.

Men can no longer draw from
above, as did Mozart, Beethoven,
Handel.

Today what we hear is very dis-
turbing noise which affects the air
inf a negative way and makes a place
heavy.

If one enters a room where a piece
of music like Handel or Mozart is on,
one would find that room tends to
swing in lightness and harmony un-
like a room were what our youths call
disco or any other form of music re-
lated to disco is on.

We find that what is called music
today is non-other than distorted
pieces and deformed tunes brought
together. Even those who intend to
compose so-called gospels only pick
from mostly the psalms and other ar-
eas. Nothing is new.

Let music be a part of our lives
on earth, let each and every one en-
joy the gift of rhythm given to us.

Listen to the swaying of trees in
the middle of a storm, the whistling
of birds, and the rustling of moving
stream which all have rhythm, all
swing in harmony. Even the laws in
creation swing in harmony.

Creation itself swings in rhythm
and total harmony to the creators will.
The universe goes around, the earth
rotates and revolves. It does so around
the sun in harmony, which is perfect,
not bending, not slow or fast, but in
absolute perfection.

In its harmony, contains that
rhythm which came into being.

We as human beings should for
once awaken, think for once. Why
and haw did music come into being?

 

How did Mozart,
Handel, Beethoven, and

the like draw their songs
from; and where from?

If one really sits down to think se-
riously about this, then one day an an-
swer will surely come.

Everything has its purpose,

He who does not appreciate mu-
sic in its little sense and is not ready
to do so could be termed as dead. Ap-
preciate it, because it flows from God,
appreciate it because it is part and par-

 

cel of creation, which issues from
the most high.

Remember the body’s metabo-
lism flows in harmony, it has a
rhythm. Even the heart beats in
rhythm and harmony, which is be-
yond human technology. Our body
formation, how we walk and how we
talk also flows in rhythm and har-
mony.

Storms in the wake of a birth.

Today, the Sardauna provides more advice to the New Nigerian Newspapers. His noble vision is as im-
pressive as it is inspiring.

at all times on this reliable

weapon: tell the truth about the
North to the world and in return tell
us the truth about the rest of the
world. I do not think that the role of
this paper should be that of answer-
ing accusations and making
counter-charges; I think the real jus-
tification for this newspaper is sim-
ply that a Northern Nigerian news-
paper can tell the story of Northern
Nigeria best.

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to say ‘well done’ to the large
number of people who have contrib-
uted in different ways to the suc-
cessful launching of this newspaper.
I would also like to put in a gentle
reminder that the time for hard work
on the part of the staff has not
ended; it has, in fact, just begun.
‘The need is there for this newspa-
per; the time is ripe and the people
are eager for something new and
fresh, sincere and interesting. But
there is no magic formula for creat-
ing a newspaper to fill these speci-
fications; nothing but hard work and
imagination, skill and determination
will make the newspaper live up to
expectations. *

[hope that with the help of God
land the support of this country’s
well-intending millions, the New Ni-
igerian will achieve the success it so
much deserves. May Allah be its
guide and protector from all ex-
pected onslaught. Amin.

In its brief existence before the
Military take-over on 15th January
1966 the New Nigerian did show
concern about the North and its
backwardness in education, eco-
nomic and social development and
the unhealthy political environment
in the country. But more impor-
tantly it showed concern about the
violence in the Western Region. In
the space of two weeks it wrote three
editorials on the subject. It drew the
attention of the Prime Minister,
Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa,
and Premier of the North for the
need to take action to put an end to
the violence,

In its editorial of 10th January it
warned Alhaji Abubakar that the
next seven days could prove among
the most decisive to this country
since we gained independence,
Prophetic! Alhaji Abubakar had
convened a meeting of the Heads
lof Government of Commonwealth
(Countries in Lagos for the following
week to discuss the Rhodesian
rebellion by Ian Smith, But in his
lown backyard of Western Nigeria -
including suburbs of Lagos -the
violence by mobs protesting the re-
election of Chief Akintola and his
supporters threatened, according to
the New Nigerian to do “irreparable
damage” to the impression of po-

I hope the New Nigerian will rely

 

 

Late Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello

litical stability which Nigeria up till
then had presented to the world, It
warmed , the Prime Minister:

“In any event if the conference
itself is allowed to be pushed into
the background by deliberately
formented violence in the West,
then Nigeria's prestige and good
name will suffer in such a way that
it will take a long time to recover
the ground lost.”

When this editorial was written
the Sardauna was out of the coun-
try, It was the month of Ramadan
and the Sardauna had travelled to
Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah, the
lesser Hajj, Umrah is an important
religious event which many Mus-
lims perform especially in the
month of Ramadan, the month of
the compulsory fast for Muslims,
The Sardauna returned to Nigeria
on the day after the aforesaid edito-
rial. On the day of his return the pa-
per came out with another editorial.

In a direct appeal to the
Sardauna the said:

“No one condones violence, No-
one should bow before it. But facts
have to be faced and the fact is that
force is having to be used to pre-
vent the violence in the West from
spreading, But this cannot possibly
be the final solution,

“This must spring from the heart
of men, From humility and magna-

nimity, For this reason we think that
Sir Ahmadu and Chief Akintola
should lead a concerted move to talk
the whole thing over, for in the
North we cannot sit back doing
nothing while our kinsmen are be-
ing killed in other parts of the
Federation,”

The Sardauna did not like this
editorial. He landed in Kano with
his retinue from Jeddah with an in-
ternational flight. He then took a
local flight to Kaduna. He must have
been shown the editorial before he
landed in Kaduna. At Kaduna air-
port he commented sarcastically to
reporters on the New Nigerian be-
ing the “so called Northern paper.

“The Sardauna felt hurt”, ac-
cording to Alhaji Ahmed Joda. In
the night, on the day of his return to
Nigeria, “he asked me in a one to
one discussion in his house if I be-
lieve that he alone is responsible for
the bloodshed in the West. He asked
other questions which I could not
answer.”

Unfortunately, the Premier had
little or no time to respond to the
editorial. He was assassinated four
days later by Major Chukwuma
Kaduna Nzeogwu. The Federal and
Regional Governments were over-
thrown after considerable blood-
shed in Kaduna, Lagos and Ibadan
and physical destruction in Kaduna

in a coup d’ etat.

The coup gave the New Nigerian
the test to demonstrate its adherence
to the principles of being a good
newspaper which it enunciated at its
inception. Although it never pub-
lished the full list of those killed or
the names of those who did the kill-
ing, -it may not have been in pos-
session of full information -it car-
ried stories of the.coup and fresh
pictures of the destruction in
Kaduna. These stories catapulted it
into national and international
prominence immediately. Other
newspapers published outside
Kaduna including the Daily Times.
which was then regarded as the
leading newspaper in the country,
copied the pictures. The Manage-
ment of the New Nigerian com-
plained that the Daily Times did not
have the courtesy to acknowledge
the source of the pictures, but felt
contented: “imitation being the sin-
cerest form of flattery “. The New
Nigerian pictures of the raid on
Sardauna’s house became “world
exclusive “ and were, -transmitted
allover the world from Accra,
Ghana. The late Maaji Masaya, staff
photographer of the New Nigerian
who took the pictures became some-
thing of a hero.

In the 1000th edition of the New
Nigerian Mr. Sharp explained the
newspaper’s coverage of the violent
change of government as follows:

.’The question is often asked:
How did you manage to publish
your famous 17 January, 1966 edi-
tion of the New Nigerian?

On the morning immediately
following the coup we were advised
by government to suspend publica-
tion until further notice, machines
were switched off , staff sent home
and doors locked.

But early on the following Sun-
day morning I could stand it no
longer. Here we were with a world
scoop in our possession and not able
to do a thing about it. So | went and
saw Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu.
He was having a wound on the side
of his neck dressed. I asked him:

“What happened to you ™

He replied: “Like Jack Demsey
said, I forgot to Duck”’”. | told him
we wanted to carry on printihg our
newspaper. “ Why, not “, he said.
“Everything must carry on as nor-
mal” “What can we put in it. What
are we allowed to publish ",1 asked.
“Anything you like “, he replied.

It was as simple as that. Later
we sought and got permission for
Pan African Airlines to fly in from
Lagos a twin engined aircraft. At
just after 4 o'clock it left for Lagos,
crammed with newspapers.

The New Nigerian had arrived,
as you might say. The following day
it was being sold at anything up to

three shillings a copy”.

In addition to publishing the sto-
ries and the pictures, the New Nige-
rian. two days after the coup cou-
rageously went forward to interview
Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu on
why he staged the coup, his plans
for the country and his relationship
with Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi.
General Ironsi, the General Officer
Commanding the Army had broad-
cast from Lagos to the Nation the
night before, that he had taken over
the government of Nigeria as the
country’s Head of State and Su-
preme Commander of the Nigerian
Armed Forces with effect from 16th
January, The New Nigerian pro-
duced an afternoon edition on 18th
January carrying stories of the in-
terview with Nzeogwu including
the terms of agreement between
Ironsi and Nzeogwu. In return for
pledging allegiance to Ironsi and the
federal forces, Ironsi agreed to
Nzeogwu’s five terms:

1. Safe conduct for himself, his
officers and all the men who “car-
ried out the coup on the night of
January 15.”

2. A guarantee of freedom from
legal proceedings, now, or at any
time in the future, for officers and
men who took part.

3. An assurance that the “people
we fought to remove will not be re-
turned to office.”

4. Compensation to be paid to
the families of all the officers and
men who lost their lives in Kaduna,
or other parts of Nigeria.

5. All officers and men arrested
in the West to~be released.

Copies of the afternoon edition
of the New Nigerian were flown to
Lagos and distributed widely in the
South as well as in the North. The
stories were quoted extensively by
Reuters and the name of the news-
paper was quoted as the source of
the stories all over the world by
World Broadcasting Stations. The

he patronage of
second-hand clothes
better known as

okrika in Nigeria has been
on the increase lately. A visit
to major commercial spots
within the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) like Zuba,
Karmo, Berger Junction will
confirm the popularity of
these hitherto despised
clothes. In these places trad-
ers of okrika are seen dis-
playing their second-hand
wares.

As if in response to the
seeming endless ringing of
bells and use of verbal gim-
micks by the traders, people
are often seen in clusters,
bending down at intervals to
select or sample these sec-
ond-hand articles.

Timothy, a self-employed
young man at Wuse New
Market, was haggling for sec-
ond-hand trousers when
Daily Trust accosted him. He
said that with the rising cost
of things in the country,
coupled with the high rate of
unemployment “certain
things one needs desperately
can’t be got at the usual
price. Therefore one has to
settle for second-hand
ones.”

Another okrika patron,
Duke Ekpo, told Daily Trust
that for as long as prices of
essential things soar so will
second-hand clothes be fash-
ionable among Nigerians. “If

Guidelines for purchasing goods and

hen we go to do
our shopping, we
are usually faced

with the problem of what to
choose or select from among
the numerous products
available.

Now, this may not really
be easy because these
products are all trying to
undo each other in claiming
to be either the most suitable,
best, cheapest etc.

To crown matters, most of
the products are usually ac-
companied with
concentrated promotion
campaigns with invented
exhibition methods, sales,
clearance etc. All these make
it all the more difficult to
detect the substandard or
imitated ones to avoid being
cheated.

This situation has
prompted us to ask ourselves
the question:-

What can we do to obtain
suitable goods that will suit
our needs, preserve our
health and safety, and at the
same time be of good quality
within the limits of our
budget?

Rules of purchase

-Goods shouid be free of
defects.

-Prices should tally with
descriptions.

you buy a second-hand car,
for instance, which is almost
70 percent lower than the
original value cost, you will
still derive the desired satis-
faction since the essence of
buying the car is to move you
around,” he said.

Surprisingly, even the
seemingly affluent ones are
not left out in the patronage
of okrika. Daily Trust spot-
ted an expatriate in New
Wuse Market sweating pro-
fusely in the mid-day sun,
haggling over a second-hand
clothe.

Eke Robinson, an envi-
ronmentalist, affirmed that in

an ailing economic situation,
the only succour for the less
financially buoyant ones to
procure products not usually
within the reach of the poor
is the second-hand value of
such a product.

“Since we lack the re-
sources and expertise to pro-
duce some certain products,
which are imported from
abroad at the expense of the
poor who can’t afford to buy
it at fixed price, it is then ap-
preciated as an okrika,” he
said.

-Goods should conform
with the description written

by the seller. For example, a

-Don’t purchase items
without descriptions (speci-
fications).

-Items should suit the
purpose of use and should
be made known to consum-

says ‘this tablet cures head-

How to carry out

shopping

-Compile a list of your
purchase and this will save
time and money. Organised
shopping is better than ran-
dom shopping as it
minimises efforts.

-Discuss your purchase
decision with others and this
will increase your knowledge.

-Haggle if and where nec-
essary.

-Don’t purchase quanti-
ties more than you need.

-Visit more than one shop
to compare prices before pur-
chase.

-Inspect items properly
to make sure that they are
without defects.

-Obtain and read through

-Don’t allow kids to pur-
chase your items.

Purchase of services

Purchase of services is

out its work professionally as

b. Make sure duration for

specified.

c. Make sure you obtain
a receipt after making pay-

some of these second-hand
clothes are, in fact, compa-
rable to those sold in bou-
tiques in terms of quality.
“Boutique clothes tend to be
more expensive because they
pay for rents of their shops

Nevertheless some
people fear that there may be
health hazards associated
with using these Okrika
clothes since they are said to
have been used by some
other persons before being
imported to Nigeria.

Daily Trust spoke with
National Agency for Food
and Drug Control NAFDAC
officials on this, but they de-
clined making any comment,
saying that the agency does
not deal with matters relating
to Okrika.

But an official with the
Public Health Department of
the Federal Capital Develop-
ment Authority (FCDA) told|
Daily Trust, that there are in-
deed health risks associated
with patronising Okrika.

“There are certain dis-
eases like eczema, scabies,
skin rashes and even leprosy’
that people who wear Okrika
clothes can contact. Dis-
eases like athletes feet can
also be contacted by second-
hand shoes,” he said.

The health official ad-
vised that those who buy
Okrika should ensure that'
they wash these materials
with antibiotics and deter-
gents once purchased before
wearing.

alencia’s Argentine
playmaker Pablo
Aimar is on course

for a return to first-team
action in Wednesday’s
(Champions League quarter-
final first leg against Arsenal.
Aimar has not played
since suffering a leg injury in
a 2-1 win over Panathinaikos
jon March 13 and Valencia
lhave struggled in his absence,
losing their last two league
games to slip 10 points off the
league title pace in Spain.
The talented midfielder
lwas back in training on
Sunday, though, and the
club’s medical staff will
make a final decision on his
fitness on Monday.

“If Aimar trains at a 100
percent like he did today then
he will be available for
selection,” club doctor Jorge
Candel said.

in Munich - after two

years of grimacing

pretending that the
Champions League Final
defeat by Manchester United
didn’t hurt, of waiting for the
pain to go away.
At last the moment of
retribution is at hand. There
is an iron determination that
this time, there will be no
mistake.

Everything in Bavaria has
been swept aside for the
confrontation that matters.

The victory put the
Rockets into a tie with the
Seattle SuperSonics behind
the Minnesota Timberwolves
lby 21/2 games in the race for
the fine spot in the Western
Conference playoffs.
Houston trailed after each

the decisive run.

“It was hard to
concentrate out there,”
admitted Bayern captain
Stefan Effenberg after the 2-
0 victory. ‘Everyone at the
club is thinking about
Manchester United. We
really wanted them in the
draw. Now we’ve got them,
it’s difficult to turn our
thoughts to the Bundesliga.

Leading 1-0 until the cusp

T: iger Woods and Vijay
Singh are resting for their
Augusta showdown.
Emnie Els is still at work.

The Big Easy, one of the fa-
vorites in this week’s Masters, is
among the big names scheduled
to tee off Thursday at Augusta
National, the year’s first major.

Els hasn’t been happy with
the state of his game, so he de-
cided to play a tournament the
week before Augusta for only the
second time in seven years.

“T’ve done it both ways,” he
said. “I’ve played going into ma-
jors. I’ve taken weeks off. It’s just
the way your game is.”

Els missed the cut in two of
his last four events, including The
Players Championship, and
hasn’t finished higher than 25th
in that span. He traces his prob-
lems to a faulty grip, so he’s been
spending extra time on the range
to get his hands back where they
should be.

“My form of late suggests to
me to play this week,” Els said.
“I’m working on a couple of
things in my game, and I feel that
playing and working on it is bet-
ter than staying on the range and
practicing and thinking about
Augusta too much.”

Not so for Woods, winner of
the last three majors, and Singh,
the defending Masters champion.
David Duval also decided to stay
away, taking away some of the
lustre from the BellSouth field.

“When I’m sitting around and
not playing and not doing any-
thing, then I might as well be at
home where it’s more comfort-
able,” Els said, bundled up after
a frigid pro-amme round
Wednesday morning.
“That will be a bit of a
problem, a bit of a distrac-
tion, before this week
starts.”

Love decided to play
in the BellSouth while he
was in the middle of his
second round at The Play-
ers Championship last Fri-
day.

“It was funny,” be}
missed the cut, but

 

  
    
    

about coming here, and
obviously leading into P=
Augusta and Hilton Head.
1 knew I had three good
weeks to play.”

Love also looks for-
ward to a brief respite in
all the talk about a Tiger
Slam. With a victory at |
Augusta, Woods can be- }§
come the first player to j=
hold all four major profes-
sional titles at the same
time.

“You get two ques-
tions about how your
game is shaping up and

time in Augusta.

five for what do you think abou!
Tiger, because he can’t answe
them all,” Love said. “But the gu
lives for that kind of pressure. Hq
wants to be the man and prove thal
he is the man. And if he keeps mak;
ing putts like he has the last tw
weeks and keeps getting the righ|
bounces, he’s obviously going t
be the favorite.”

The 7,259-yard course pro
vided Phil Mickelson with a chancq
to make some of the creative shots
he’ll need to have in the Augusts
repertoire.

“It’s important to drive the bal}
well here,” Mickel-son said. “But
also feel if you miss a shot here, i
gives you the opportunity to re
cover. It’s not one-dimensional lik¢
we’ve had some weeks, where thd
rough is so thick you can only
wedge out.”

Mickelson has never won
major, an admitted shortcoming i
an otherwise fine career, but he if
playing well this year. He won thy
Buick Invitational, was runner-uy
to Woods at Bay Hill and finisheq
third at Pebble Beach.

The left-hander believes thal
playing the week before gives hirt
the best chance to break through if
a major.

“I know that after being ou
here nine years, it’s disappointing
not to have won a major,
Mickelson said. “I try not to think
about how bad I would dearly lov«
to win one, and really try to focu;
on the fact that I’ve improved ove
the last year and that I have beer
playing well. 1 want to carry tha)
play over into Augusta.”

while appraising the overall

which featured in the African
Youth Championship that
ended last weekend with

Keshi who regretted the

oker Secondary School,

emerged winner of this year's
Malta Guinness Principal's
Cup by beating Sango Sec-
ondary School, Agege, 4-1
on penalties.

The keenly contested fi-
nal match played at the main
bowl of the National Sta-
dium, Lagos, was watched
by dignitaries including D.
Matt Murphy, the managing
director of Guinness Nigeria
ple and ended 1-1 during
regulation time.

Akito Ayodeji scored the
first goal in the 65 minute to
put the Agege lads ahead but
shortly after, in the 72nd
minute, Muritala Isiaka
equalized for Coker Second-
ary School.

Isiaka's beautiful gdal
came through a direct free
kick after he was brought
down by one of his oppo-
nents. The match ended on
level ground resulting into
penalty to decide the winner.

The Orile lads triumphed
‘through by converting four,
while their opponents con-
verted only one of the pen-
alty shoot-outs.

They won a cash prize of
200,000 naira, a giant trophy
and gold medal.

Their coach, Ephraim

a penalty shootout at the end.
That was why I trained them
well on how to take penalty
kicks accurately".

Sango Secondary School

his team's failure was a
shock, adding that he had not
been able to figure out what
went wrong.

gentina 2001.

"From what Ethiopia,
Egypt and others played, I
don't know whether we will
have good representation in
the Argentina 2001 champi-
onship. I am not really cer-
tain the quality of play at the
Ethiopia 2001 championship

: |No hope for Africa - Keshi

Albeit, he thumped down
the Flying Eagles for the
poor outing, Keshi could not,
however, fault the individual
talents that abound in the
team. "We had quite a crop
of individual players, but it
was unfortunate we could not
just click. Quite inexplicably,
we fared badly. Yes, prepa-
ration and all that combined
to weaken the Flying Ea-
gles".

Keshi, though, insisted
the problem was basically
not because the Flying Ea-
gles were largely composed
of home-based. "No, they are
good and | must confess that
I was impressed except the
bunch did not click as ex-
pected".

The former assistant

coach of the Super Eagles
said in future, he would still
work with a team compris-
ing largely of home-based.
He, however, would expect
the authority to provide the
means necessary for ad-
equate preparation for any
championship.

that the embassy had last
week turned down the visa
applications filled in Abuja.

Akoja said officials of the
Embassy said the applica-
tions should have been filed
at least, one month before the
departure date.

He said the late arrival of
the invitation and the inabil-
ity of the federation to secure
sponsorship on time were re-
sponsible for the delay in fil-
ing the visa applications,
adding that the High Com-
mission did not accept the
explanation.

Akoja said, however, that
following the intervention of
the Federal Ministry of
Sports and Social Develop-
ment and the Rivers State
government - the sponsor of
the judokas - the Britons had
relented and agreed to con-
duct interviews for the
judokas this week in Lagos.

He said the situation was
still dicey as the Britons
claimed they did not have
enough hands to do the job.

The judokas - five males
and five females - are ex-
pected to represent the coun-
try at the championships.

Sports associations

he proposal by the Sports

Minister, Mr. Ishaya
Mark Aku, that individuals
vying for executive positions
within sports associations pay
a deposit of 1 million naira
has been jettisoned.

Also jettisoned during the
meeting of sports association
Chairmen, was the proposal
that corporate organisations
take over associations should
provide such bodies with the
key officials.

Official sources pleading
anonymity told NAN that the
minister was reminded that
invididuals who pay the
proposed 1 million naira may
hijack the association to the
detriment of the sports
concerned.

On the corporate take-
over of associations, the
chairmen informed the
minister that in view of the
rivalry in the corporate world,
no organisation would be
interested in sponsoring a
sports competition which is
being run by another
company.

The minister was told that
corporate organisations’ have
their objectives and running
sports is not one of them, the
best they could do is to assist
sports bodies by sponsoring
their tournaments.

Aku was told that
corporate take-over of
particular sports have legal
implications as international
sports bodies not only frown
at such actions at national

level but could lead to
severance of assistance from
the world body.

NAN learnt that Dr.
Kalada Irunabere, Chairman
of the Nigeria Cricket
Association (NCA) called for
government legislation which
would provide tax relief for
companies which sponsor
omarts,

He said that several
individuals and corporate
organisations have
withdrawn from sponsorship
and holding positions after
“their fingers had been
burnt,” and urged the
associations to devise
strategies for attracting them
back.

Aku admitted that the
ministry had not monitored
the activities of the
associations in the past,
especially as regards those
who could not obtain a

ttisoned a

sponsor during their four-
year-term. He directed that
henceforth quarterly reports
of associations be submitted
to the ministry, On the
guidelines for elections, he
said the ministry would
continue to provide the
association secretaries,
although, he added that the
board could recommend their
remova! if they were found
wanting.

The minister said that
government was not going to
nominate any candidate for
the associations forthcoming
elections in order to allow
democracy to thrive.

NAN reports that the
associations secretaries also
sent in their inputs for the
one-day meeting,
recommending government
